However, ALI has not been extensively studied in patients with stroke. In this study, we aimed to investigate: 1) the association between ALI and stroke risk and 2) the association between ALI and all-cause mortality among patients with stroke, as well as 3) develop and interpret machine learning (ML) models to predict stroke and prognosis. Methods Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2018, logistic regression and Cox regression assessed associations of ALI with stroke and mortality. Non-linear relationships were analysed using restricted cubic spline and subgroup stratification. Logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), supported vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) were developed for stroke and mortality prediction and evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC), and metrics such as accuracy. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Gini importance enhanced the dual-interpretability of the model. Results Among the 46,451 participants, higher ALI was associated with a lower stroke risk, whereas mortality decreased with increasing ALI before stabilising at an inflection point (ALI = 40.91, P <inf>threshold</inf> < 0.001). Age stratification significantly modified the association between ALI and mortality. The RF model marginally outperformed the other models in terms of stroke identification (AUCROC: 0.9657, accuracy: 95.63 %) and mortality prediction (AUCROC: 0.7771, accuracy: 70.65 %). The SHAP and Gini importance analyses highlighted cardiovascular diseases as key factors for stroke prediction and age for mortality, with ALI being less influential. Conclusions Leveraging the nationally representative NHANES database, this exploratory analysis revealed that ALI presented a reverse dose-response association with the stroke risk and an “L-shaped” relationship with all-cause mortality among patients with stroke. Dual-interpretable RF models based on the ALI showed comparably promising potential among the six ML models for stroke identification and prognosis prediction. © © 2025.

We analyzed longitudinal data with a median 19-month follow-up. BC was diagnosed with ultrasounds and MRCP. Missing data was imputed using mean and median. Data preprocessing involved feature scaling and one-hot encoding. Survival analysis used filter (Cox-P, Cox-c) and embedded (RSF, LASSO) feature selection methods. Seven survival machine learning algorithms were used: LASSO, Ridge, RSF, E-NET, GBS, C-GBS, and FS-SVM. Model development employed 5-fold cross-validation, random oversampling, and hyperparameter tuning. Random oversampling addressed data imbalance. Optimal hyperparameters were determined based on average C-index. Features importance was assessed using standardized regression coefficients and permutation importance for top models. Stability was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation standard deviation. Finally, 1799 observations with 40 outcome predictors were included. RSF with Ridge achieved the highest performance (C-index: 0.699) for BC prediction, while RSF with RSF had the highest performance (C-index: 0.784) for mortality prediction. Top BC predictors were LT graft types, IBD in recipients, recipient’s BMI, recipient’s history of PVT, and previous LT history. For mortality, they were post-transplant AST, creatinine, recipient’s age, post-transplant ALT, and tacrolimus consumption.

Current models often lack comprehensive integration of key biomarkers, limiting their predictive power. This study aims to develop a predictive model for CVD-related mortality using a machine learning-based feature selection algorithm and assess its performance compared to existing models. We analyzed data from a cohort of 4,882 adults recruited between 1999 and 2004, followed for up to 20 years. After applying the Boruta algorithm for feature selection, key biomarkers including NT-proBNP, cardiac troponins, and homocysteine were identified as significant predictors of CVD mortality. Predictive models were built using these biomarkers alongside demographic and clinical variables. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, with internal validation conducted through bootstrap sampling. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to assess clinical benefit. The combined model, incorporating both biomarkers and demographic variables, demonstrated superior predictive performance with a C-index of 0.9205 (95% CI: 0.9129–0.9319), outperforming models with demographic variables alone (C-index: 0.9030 (95% CI: 0.8938–0.9147)) or biomarkers alone (C-index: 0.8659 (95% CI: 0.8519–0.8826)). Cox regression analysis further identified key predictors of CVD mortality, including elevated AST/ALT, TyG, BUN, and systolic blood pressure, with protective factors such as higher chloride and iron levels. Nomogram construction and DCA confirmed that the combined model provided substantial net benefit across various time points. The integration of cardiac biomarkers, lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers significantly improves the accuracy of predictive models for CVD-related mortality. This novel approach offers enhanced prognostication, with potential for further optimization through the inclusion of additional clinical and lifestyle data. © The Author(s) 2025.","39900681","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study aims to evaluate the combined effect of the SHR and GV with predict short-term, medium-term and long-term mortality outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This retrospective study utilised data from the MIMIC-IV database, including adult ICU patients diagnosed with ischaemic stroke. SHR and GV were calculated and categorised into tertiles, with combined effects grouped into four categories. Study outcomes included 30-day, 90-day, and 360-day mortality outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves, restricted cubic splines and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the SHR and GV with mortality outcomes. Then, we further assessed the associations with subgroup analyses by diabetes, age, sex, and body mass index. Predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) comparisons. Results: In 749 patients with IS (age 72.9 [61.1–83.0] years; 47.3% male), and 30-day, 90-day, and 360-day ICU mortality rates of 23.2%, 29.6%, and 35.4%, respectively. Patients with both high SHR and high GV (G4 vs. G1) had the highest mortality risk in the overall population, with HRs of 2.43 (95% CI: 1.42–4.14) for 30-day mortality, 2.18 (95% CI: 1.36–3.06) for 90-day mortality, and 1.77 (95% CI: 1.14–2.74) for 360-day mortality. The combined effect of SHR and GV demonstrated superior predictive performance (AUC: 0.643 for 30-day, 0.652 for 90-day, and 0.640 for 360-day mortality) compared to SHR or GV alone. These findings highlight the prognostic utility of combining SHR and GV for mortality prediction in critically ill patients with IS.

The Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio (SHR), a novel metric of glucose control, has shown promise in predicting adverse outcomes in cardiovascular diseases. However, its impact on the relationship between organ dysfunction and mortality in AF remains unclear. This study aims to explore SHR’s role in modifying this association to improve risk prediction in critically ill AF patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed on MIMIC-IV 3.1 patients with critical illness and AF. The primary endpoints were in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality. Patients were stratified by SHR quartiles and categorized into four groups based on combined SHR and SOFA scores. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression assessed the association with mortality, and restriction cubic splines (RCS) were used to examine non-linear relationships. Mediation analysis using the Bootstrap method quantified the role of serum bicarbonate. A nomogram was developed with multivariable logistic regression, incorporating SHR, SOFA, and significant covariates from backward selection. The SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) analysis provided insights into predictor contributions. Results: Of the 15,358 patients included in the cohort, the median age was 66 years (IQR: 55–76), with 56.8% being male. The SHR-SOFA combination significantly stratified patients into four distinct risk groups (Q1-Q4), with the high SHR and high SOFA group (Q4) showing the poorest prognosis at all time points (log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that Q4 had the highest mortality risk across all time points (in-hospital HR: 5.32, 95% CI: 4.31–6.57; 30-day HR: 4.27, 95% CI: 3.62–5.04; 1-year HR: 3.18, 95% CI: 2.82–3.59). RCS analysis indicated a nonlinear correlation between SHR and mortality, with a threshold effect at SHR = 1.0 in low SOFA patients. In contrast, high SOFA patients showed a J-shaped curve, with an ideal SHR of 1.2. The predictive nomogram, validated through backward stepwise regression, included SHR, SOFA score, age, mean arterial pressure (MBP), white blood cell count (WBC), bicarbonate, hemoglobin, sodium, and total calcium as key predictors. SHAP analysis highlighted SHR and SOFA as the most influential predictors, with age also playing a crucial role. Mediation analysis indicated that serum bicarbonate mediated 22.7% of SHR’s effect on in-hospital mortality, diminishing over time. Conclusions: This study reveals a notable relationship among SHR and SOFA scores in forecasting mortality among critically sick patients with atrial fibrillation. The developed nomogram integrating SHR, SOFA, and other covariates offers a novel tool for risk stratification. SHAP analysis confirms SHR and SOFA as key predictors, highlighting their clinical utility in mortality assessment. © The Author(s) 2025.","41194138","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Prior studies indicate that SHR is related to the prognosis of certain diseases. This study investigated the predictive accuracy of SHR for in-hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients. Methods: We analyzed 4,418 AKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. SHR was calculated as admission blood glucose (mg/dl) divided by (28.7 × HbA1c(%) − 46.7). Patients were stratified into four groups based on SHR levels. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to assess the association between SHR and mortality, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to compare mortality rates stratified by SHR groups. Subgroup analyses evaluated the consistency of these associations across clinically relevant populations. Machine learning algorithms (Boruta feature selection, logistic regression, random forest) were employed to build predictive models. Results: Among 4,418 patients (36.03% female), in-hospital and ICU mortality rates were 6.88% and 4.48%, respectively. A U-shaped relationship was observed between SHR and mortality (nonlinear p = 0.015 for in-hospital, p = 0.048 for ICU mortality). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant survival differences across SHR groups (log-rank p < 0.01). Cox regression showed that each unit increase in SHR was associated with 23% higher in-hospital mortality (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09–1.40) and 47% higher ICU mortality (HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.25–1.74). Machine learning models achieved AUCs of 0.76–0.77 for mortality prediction. Conclusions: In critically ill AKI patients, higher SHR is associated with increased mortality after adjustment for key covariates. However, its modest standalone discriminative capacity indicates that SHR is best combined with other clinical variables rather than used alone. © The Author(s) 2025.","41152738","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This retrospective analysis used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, a publicly available critical care database, focusing on TSICU/SICU patients. HGI was calculated as the difference between observed and predicted HbA1c levels. Associations between HGI quartiles and 28-day and 360-day mortality were assessed using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, multivariate Cox regression, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models. A stacked ensemble machine learning model validated HGI’s predictive power, and mediation analysis evaluated sodium as a mediator. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significant survival differences across HGI quartiles (log-rank p < 0.001), with the lowest quartile demonstrating the worst outcomes. Cox regression revealed that higher HGI was independently associated with lower 28-day and 360-day mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72–0.81, p < 0.001).

However, the impact of its dynamic fluctuations on patient outcomes remains insufficiently explored. This study seeks to investigate the relationship between HGI trajectory changes over time and the prognosis of patients with sepsis, and developing an optimal predictive model for 28-day and 90-day mortality risk using machine learning techniques. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV 3.0 database were employed to construct a linear regression model utilizing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) measured at six distinct time points to calculate HGI. Trajectory analysis revealed three distinct HGI change patterns: rising (RS), stable (ST), and descending (DS). Based on these groupings, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression models, and mediation analysis were applied. Lasso regression was utilized for feature selection, and four machine learning models—Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest (RF)—were developed and evaluated through ROC curves, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were incorporated for interpretability, and nomograms for 28-day and 90-day mortality were generated. Results: A total of 2,616 patients were included in the analysis, with 407 patients (15.56%) dying within 28 days. multivariable Cox regression analysis, using the ST group as a reference, revealed that patients in the RS group had a significantly higher risk of death at both 28 days and 90 days, whereas those in the DS group demonstrated a markedly reduced risk. These findings were consistent across all models. Among the models evaluated, the Logistic Regression model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, with AUC values for the 28-day mortality prediction in the training and validation sets of 0.743 and 0.732, respectively, and for 90-day mortality of 0.748 and 0.735. The key predictive factors for 28-day mortality included albumin, HGI, renal injury, and the APSIII score, while for 90-day mortality, renal injury, APSIII score, HGI, and albumin were the most influential variables. To enhance the clinical applicability of these models, nomograms for 28-day and 90-day mortality were constructed, achieving AUCs of 0.715 and 0.747, respectively. Calibration curves demonstrated strong concordance between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes. Conclusion: Dynamic alterations in HGI during follow-up were found to be significantly associated with the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis at both 28 days and 90 days.

Lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) has been proposed as a novel indicator to estimate the likelihood of death. Using data from the MIMIC database, this retrospective study assessed lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) effectiveness in forecasting outcomes among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Patients were grouped into four quartiles based on their lactate-to-albumin ratio (LAR) values. Analysis using the Kaplan–Meier method revealed a clear difference in survival outcomes among the groups, with individuals with higher levels of LAR indicating a higher observed mortality rate. The RCS analysis identified a distinct nonlinear link between LAR values and overall 28-day death rates (P < 0.001), which retained statistical significance after covariate adjustment (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression verified that LAR independently correlates with 28-day death risk (HR = 1.309, 95% CI: 1.113–1.540). Subgroup analyses consistently indicated increased mortality risks in Q4 across most strata. Both the Boruta and LASSO algorithms identified LAR as a key determinant of 28-day mortality. Among the machine learning models evaluated, the Random Survival Forest (RSF) model demonstrated strong overall predictive performance for 14-day (AUC: 0.948) and 28-day (AUC: 0.887) mortality prediction in both the training and test datasets. The prediction model incorporating LAR achieved outstanding results across multiple algorithmic methods, serving as an effective and simple clinical tool that enables risk stratification and guides therapeutic decision-making through the integration of multidimensional parameters. © The Author(s) 2025.","41107476","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the usefulness of ML models has yet to be fully elucidated for sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk using long-term follow-up electronic health records (EHRs). This study aimed to develop and validate ML models for SCD risk prediction among community-dwelling older adults using 6-year primary-care EHRs data. Methods: Data were obtained from the Jinnan Study, an EHR-based cohort of older adults. A total of 30,535 individuals aged ≥ 65 years from three towns were included. The primary outcome was SCD. Candidate predictors included gender, age, heart rate, body mass index (BMI), waist, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), physical activity, current smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), QTc prolongation and ST wave abnormality. We employed the data of one town as the training dataset (16,049 individuals), and the data of other 2 towns as the test dataset (14,486 individuals). The two feature selection strategies used were Cox proportional hazards model (Cox model) and random survival forests model (RSF model). Cox model, Fine-gray model, RSF model, lasso Cox regression model and boosted Cox regression model were fitted, optimized through 5-fold cross-validation using the training dataset, and externally validated on the test dataset. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. Results: With a median follow-up of 5.67 years, 224 SCD events occurred. RSF outperformed other models, with a C-index of 0.820 in the training set and 0.757 in the test dataset (P < 0.001). Calibration plots indicated that most SCD events occurred in individuals within the highest deciles of predicted risk. Summary plots using the “survex” package were generated to enhance interpretability of the RSF model. Conclusion: ML models can significantly enhance the prediction of SCD risk using community-based EHRs. Our proposed risk model may enable the identification of high-risk individuals among older adults, facilitating targeted interventions and personalized care strategies. Future research should focus on integrating this model into routine primary care workflows and evaluating its effectiveness in real-world settings. © The Author(s) 2025.","41107790","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We examined the prognostic capacity of admission blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) - a low-cost renal biomarker - for 28-/365-day mortality prediction in AF through multidimensional survival analyses leveraging the MIMIC-IV 3.1 database. Data relevant to AF patients were extracted from the publicly available MIMIC-IV 3.1 database based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cox proportional hazards regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) models were used to assess the association between the BUN/Cr and the risk of 28-day and 365-day mortality. Subsequently, a short-term and long-term mortality risk prediction model for AF patients was developed using interpretable machine learning algorithms, incorporating the BUN/Cr and other clinical features. The MIMIC-IV analysis included 14,725 AF patients (72.9 ± 11.7 years, 60.3% male). Cox regression identified BUN/Cr as an independent predictor of 28-day and 365-day mortality, with risk quintiles showing a non-linear pattern: Q5 (> 27.8), Q4 (22.0–27.8), Q1 (≤ 15.0), Q3 (18.5–22.0), and Q2 (15.0–18.5). Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed decreasing survival with elevated BUN/Cr. Restricted cubic splines revealed U-shaped mortality relationships (P < 0.001), with inflection points at BUN/Cr = 16.49 (28-day) and 16.67 (365-day). Among machine learning models, XGBoost outperformed others in predicting mortality (28-day: AUC = 0.793 [0.776–0.810], Accuracy = 73.1%; 365-day: AUC = 0.778 [0.764–0.793], Accuracy = 69.8%). SHAP analysis ranked BUN/Cr fourth among predictors for both endpoints. The BUN/Cr emerged as a robust independent predictor of short- and long-term mortality in AF. The interpretable XGBoost model, integrating BUN/Cr with clinical variables, achieved superior predictive accuracy for 28-/365-day outcomes while maintaining generalizability. BUN/Cr constituted a fourth-ranked feature across mortality timelines. These findings underscore its clinical utility for AF risk stratification and treatment optimization, supporting biomarker-guided therapeutic interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.","41062643","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the association between ePWV and poor prognosis in critically ill patients with ischemic stroke (IS) remains understudied. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ePWV and adverse outcomes in critically ill IS patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 3.0), stratified by ePWV quartiles. Our primary objective was to examine mortality rates at pivotal timeframes: 30 days, 90 days, and 1-year post-observation. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves complemented these analyses, along with a Cox proportional hazards model, restricted cubic spline curves (RCS), and subgroup analysis, to comprehensively evaluate the association between ePWV and all-cause mortality. To model the mortality risk, four machine learning algorithms were employed, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes (NB). Model interpretability was improved using Shapley Additive Interpretation (SHAP) analysis, with calibration validating predictive accuracy. We comprehensively compared four machine learning algorithms (LR, RF, XGBoost, NB) against five clinical risk scores. Results: Our analysis encompassed a cohort of 1,337 patients, with a male preponderance of 51.6%. The 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality rates were 14.1%, 17.9%, and 23.4%, respectively. The RCS analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in all-cause mortality risk with higher ePWV levels. Critically ill IS patients in the highest ePWV quartile had significantly higher mortality at all time points compared to lower quartiles. Boruta feature selection identified ePWV as a key predictor. The LR model demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting 30-day mortality, while XGBoost outperformed others for 90-day and 1-year mortality predictions. Conclusion: Elevated levels of the ePWV demonstrate strong prognostic value for both short- and long-term mortality in critically ill IS patients. Machine learning models incorporating ePWV outperformed traditional clinical scores, suggesting potential utility for risk stratification in acute stroke management. © The Author(s) 2025.","41013302","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While disparities in outcomes based on race and socioeconomic status have been well-documented in other spinal tumor populations, their role in spinal cord hemangioblastoma remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilize the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate the influence of race, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare access on survival outcomes in patients with spinal cord hemangioblastoma. Additionally, we explore the utility of machine learning–based survival models to improve individualized risk prediction and to identify key clinical and sociodemographic determinants of long-term survival. Patients diagnosed with spinal cord hemangioblastoma were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) using ICD-O-3 histology and topography codes. Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables were compared across racial groups (White, Black and Asian). Long-term overall survival (OS) was defined as survival beyond 10 years. Kaplan–Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate survival outcomes and identify independent predictors of mortality. Tumor size was stratified using the cohort-wide mean (62.2 mm) for interpretability. Temporal trends in racial distribution and surgical technique (open vs. MIS) were assessed using Mann–Kendall trend testing. Gradient Boosting Survival, Cox proportional hazards, and Random Survival Forest models were developed and validated for mortality prediction. The best-performing model was interpreted using SHAP analysis. A total of 716 adult patients with spinal cord hemangioblastoma were analyzed, with the majority being White (83.7%), followed by Black (12.3%) and Asian (4%). Significant differences were observed across racial groups in age, insurance status, income quartiles, and comorbidity scores, though sex distribution and facility type utilization were comparable. Most patients were treated at academic centers, and surgery alone was the predominant treatment modality, with no racial disparities in extent of resection or use of radiation. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significantly higher 10-year and long-term mortality in White patients; however, race was not an independent predictor in multivariable Cox regression, where increased age, higher CDCC scores, urban residence, and treatment at comprehensive community cancer centers were associated with worse survival. Surgery, with or without radiation, was protective compared to radiation alone. Temporal analysis showed stable racial distribution and minimal uptake of minimally invasive surgery from 2010 to 2017. The Gradient Boosting Survival model achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.8214; C-index = 0.7817), with age, facility type, and comorbidity burden identified as the strongest predictors of mortality in SHAP analysis. A publicly available web-based calculator was developed based on this model to provide individualized survival estimates. Racial and socioeconomic disparities were associated with differences in clinical outcomes on univariate analysis. However, race and insurance status were not independent predictors of mortality in multivariable-adjusted models. This suggests that the observed survival differences may be explained by confounding factors, such as comorbidity burden, treatment modality, or access to specialized care. Notably, poorer survival was independently associated with treatment at Comprehensive Community Cancer Programs and with higher comorbidity scores, underscoring the importance of ensuring equitable access to high-volume, specialized centers. Lastly, the Gradient Boosting Survival model enhanced mortality risk prediction by incorporating both clinical and socioeconomic variables, supporting its potential utility in guiding targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.","40841556","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The albumin-to-neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (ANLR) is a novel composite biomarker integrating nutritional and inflammatory status. However, its prognostic significance in sepsis remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the association between ANLR and mortality in sepsis patients using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning models. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the MIMIC-IV (v3.1) database. In this study, 6,288 patients diagnosed with sepsis and admitted to the ICU were analyzed, with participants stratified into quartiles according to their ANLR measurements. The primary endpoint was set as 30-day mortality, while 90-day mortality served as a secondary outcome. The association between ANLR and mortality was investigated through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling. Furthermore, the contribution of ANLR relative to other predictors was evaluated by developing machine learning models, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) employed to determine variable importance. Results: A higher ANLR was independently associated with improved survival. In the fully adjusted Cox model, elevated ANLR predicted a lower risk of mortality at 30 days (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59–0.79, p < 0.001) and at 90 days (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.94, p = 0.002). Machine learning analysis identified ANLR as the second most important variable influencing sepsis mortality. ANLR demonstrated superior predictive ability (AUC 0.66) compared to traditional markers, including SOFA, NLR, and albumin. Conclusions: ANLR is a robust and independent predictor of sepsis-related mortality, outperforming conventional biomarkers. Incorporating ANLR into routine clinical workflows could improve risk assessment and facilitate individualized treatment strategies for patients with severe sepsis. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and explore potential therapeutic implications. © The Author(s) 2025.","40813626","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To study this, large-scale multi-modal data are crucial. However, such data are scarce as population-based cohorts are generally restricted in sharing their data. Here, we employ federated learning to study the relationship between the two types of biological age scores: BrainAge based on brain MRI and MetaboAge based on metabolites. Using three large population-based cohorts, we trained a federated deep learning model to estimate BrainAge and compared its performance to models trained in a single cohort. The federated BrainAge model yielded significantly lower error for age prediction across the cohorts than locally trained models. Harmonizing the age interval between cohorts further improved BrainAge accuracy. Subsequently, we compared BrainAge and MetaboAge by performing association analysis and survival analysis for dementia and mortality prediction to further characterize both scores. The association analysis showed a weak association between BrainAge and MetaboAge, while the survival analysis indicated complementary predictive values for the mortality risk of the two scores. Federated learning has been shown to be a valuable technique for enabling the use of research cohorts that are restricted in data sharing.

Lifestyle factors and physical activity levels have been identified as critical modifiable risk factors influencing AD outcomes, but their precise impact on mortality prediction remains understudied. This study aimed to employ machine learning (ML) techniques to predict mortality risk in AD patients, leveraging data on lifestyle and physical activity to enhance personalized care strategies and inform public health policies. We analyzed data from 53,231 participants collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2007–2020). Participants were stratified by AD symptom severity using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Cox proportional hazards models were developed and validated using a training set (n = 42,585) and test set (n = 10,646). Model performance was evaluated using the integrated area under the curve (iAUC), integrated Brier score/prediction error (iBS/PE), and concordance index (C-index). The RSF model outperformed the Cox model, achieving higher discrimination and calibration. Specifically, the RSF demonstrated an iAUC of 0.781 (95% CI 0.778–0.839), iBS/PE of 0.150 (95% CI 0.083–0.122), and a C-index of 0.785 (95% CI 0.776–0.800) in the no-symptom group of the training cohort. These metrics indicate superior predictive accuracy, especially at extreme ends of risk prediction. Lifestyle and physical activity levels were identified as significant predictors influencing mortality risk. ML algorithms, notably RSF, effectively predict mortality risk in AD patients, demonstrating clear advantages over traditional statistical models. Incorporating lifestyle and physical activity into ML-based predictive frameworks can significantly improve risk stratification, informing targeted interventions. Further external validation across diverse populations is necessary to establish broader applicability. © The Author(s) 2025.","40707523","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Traditional obesity indicators inadequately predict the mortality risk in this population. Thus, the research aimed to evaluate new obesity indicators to explore their close association with RA mortality. Methods: This study analyzed 101,316 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants (1999–2018) to evaluate alternative adiposity indices for RA mortality prediction. Missing data were imputed using the random forest method. Key covariates were selected using the Boruta algorithm and weighted univariate Cox regression. Multivariable-adjusted models generated hazard ratios (95% confidence interval), validated by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and Harrell’s C-index. Survival patterns were assessed with restricted cubic splines (RCS) and Kaplan–Meier curves. Threshold effects and robustness were analyzed via segmented Cox models and sensitivity analyses. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) identified A Body Shape Index (ABSI) as the strongest predictor. Results: Among the 1,266 individuals, 299 deaths occurred during follow-up (190 all-cause, 59 cardiovascular, 50 cancer). ABSI predicted the 5-, 10-, and 20-year mortality (area under the curve: 0.823, 0.801, 0.752, respectively) and outperformed other indices in the Harrell’s C-index. Weighted multivariable Cox regression linked higher ABSI × 100 values with increased mortality; Kaplan–Meier curves confirmed reduced survival in the highest quartile (P < 0.001). RCS revealed a U-curve association linking ABSI × 100 to mortality. Moreover, the mediating effects analysis indicated the Monocyte-to-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index, and Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index played significant roles as mediators, with mediation ratios of 4.9%, 5.1%, 8.5%, and 4.5%, respectively. Additional sensitivity analyses validated these results. Quartile stratification revealed a pronounced risk amplification in the highest quartile (Q4), particularly in the fully adjusted specification (Hazard ratio = 3.43, 1.45–8.14; P = 0.005). Furthermore, XGBoost results indicate that ABSI is the best obesity metric for predicting the prognosis of patients with RA. Conclusions: This study revealed a potential clinical value of a new obesity index, specifically the ABSI, in predicting the survival rates among individuals with RA. Inflammatory markers appear to play a partial mediating role in this relationship. © The Author(s) 2025.","40349028","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the prognostic significance of combined SHR-GV evaluation for ASCVD mortality remains unclear. This study examines associations of SHR, GV, and their synergistic effects with mortality in patients with ASCVD across different glucose metabolic states, incorporating machine learning (ML) to identify critical risk factors influencing mortality. Methods: Patients with ASCVD were screened in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and stratified into normal glucose regulation (NGR), pre-diabetes mellitus (Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus (DM) groups based on glucose metabolic status. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality, with 90-day mortality as the secondary outcome. SHR and GV levels were categorized into tertiles. Associations with mortality were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier(KM) curves, Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic splines (RCS), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, landmark analyses, and subgroup analyses. Five ML algorithms were employed for mortality risk prediction, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) applied to identify critical predictors. Results: A total of 2807 patients were included, with a median age of 71 years, and 58.78% were male. Overall, 483 (23.14%) and 608 (29.13%) patients died within 28 and 90 days of ICU admission, respectively. In NGR and Pre-DM subgroups, combined SHR-GV assessment demonstrated superior predictive performance for 28-day mortality versus SHR alone [NGR: AUC 0.688 (0.636–0.739) vs. 0.623 (0.568–0.679), P = 0.028; Pre-DM: 0.712 (0.659–0.764) vs. 0.639 (0.582–0.696), P = 0.102] and GV alone [NGR: 0.688 vs. 0.578 (0.524–0.633), P < 0.001; Pre-DM: 0.712 vs. 0.593 (0.524–0.652), P < 0.001]. Consistent findings were observed for 90-day mortality prediction. However, in the DM subgroup, combined assessment improved prediction only for 90-day mortality vs. SHR alone [AUC 0.578 (0.541–0.616) vs. 0.560 (0.520–0.599), P = 0.027], without significant advantages in other comparisons. Conclusions: Combined SHR and GV assessment serves as a critical prognostic tool for ASCVD mortality, providing enhanced predictive accuracy compared to individual metrics, particularly in NGR and Pre-DM patients. This integrated approach could inform personalized glycemic management strategies, potentially improving clinical outcomes.

We aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive prognostic model integrating demographic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical parameters. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 445 heart failure patients. The cohort was randomly divided into training (n = 312) and validation (n = 133) sets. Feature selection was performed using LASSO regression followed by backward stepwise Cox regression. A nomogram was constructed based on independent predictors. Model performance was assessed through discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analyses. Random survival forest analysis was conducted to validate variable importance. Results: During a median follow-up of 4.14 years, 142 deaths (31.91%) occurred. Our model development followed a systematic approach: initial feature selection using LASSO regression identified 15 potential predictors, which were further refined to nine independent predictors through backward stepwise Cox regression. The final predictors included age, NYHA class, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, atrial septal defect, aortic valve annulus calcification, tricuspid regurgitation severity, QRS duration, T wave offset, and NT-proBNP. The integrated model demonstrated good discrimination for 2-, 3-, and 5-year mortality prediction in both training (AUCs: 0.726, 0.755, 0.809) and validation cohorts (AUCs: 0.686, 0.678, 0.706). Calibration plots and decision curve analyses confirmed the model’s reliability and clinical utility across different time horizons. A nomogram was constructed for individualized risk prediction. Kaplan-Meier analyses of individual predictors revealed significant stratification of survival outcomes, while restricted cubic spline analyses demonstrated non-linear relationships between continuous variables and mortality risk. Random survival forest analysis identified the top five predictors (age, NT-proBNP, QRS duration, tricuspid regurgitation severity, NYHA), which were compared with our nine-variable model, confirming the superior performance of the integrated model across all time points. Conclusions: Our integrated prognostic model showed robust performance in predicting all-cause mortality in heart failure patients. The model’s ability to provide individualized risk estimates through a nomogram may facilitate clinical decision-making and patient stratification.

Objectives: This study aimed to apply an unsupervised machine learning approach to integrate clinical and advanced echocardiographic data, identifying CS subphenotypes associated with different outcomes and features, beyond etiology. Methods: This multicenter observational study prospectively analyzed 172 patients admitted to cardiac intensive care units with overt CS, from 2021. An exploratory statistical analysis preceded patient clustering using the Elbow Method and K-Means algorithm, based on clinical presentation. Dimensionality reduction was performed with principal component analysis. Phenotypes were further stratified according to the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions stages. Results: Five distinct phenotypes (I–V) were identified, showing progressively increasing in-hospital mortality rates: 25% (I), 32% (II), 39% (III), 41% (IV), and 60% (V). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a stepwise increase in mortality risk. Phenotypes IV and V had significantly higher mortality than phenotype I (HR: 2.78 [95% CI: 1.07-7.19] and HR: 2.80 [95% CI: 1.10-7.14]; P < 0.05). Mortality prediction remained independent after adjustment for confounding factors, and independently of Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions stage. Phenotype I had the lowest mortality, with higher arterial pressure and moderate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, whereas phenotype II exhibited marked LV failure. Oppositely, phenotypes IV and V had severe congestion despite only mild LV impairment. Conclusions: Machine learning, newly integrating echocardiographic data, identified 5 distinct CS phenotypes, each with unique clinical/echocardiographic features and mortality risks. These insights could support personalized treatment strategies in CS patients, pending further validation. © 2025 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Due to the absence of hormonal receptors and HER2, standard treatment relies on chemotherapy, yielding limited outcomes in overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). The molecular heterogeneity of TNBC complicates risk stratification and personalized treatment approaches. In this context, unsupervised machine learning could improve the identification of clinically homogeneous subgroups and facilitate prognostic predictions. Objective: To develop predictive models for OS and RFS in TNBC patients using machine learning algorithms, specifically k-prototypes for subgroup identification and random forest for outcome prediction. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 4808 TNBC patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2024. Clinical, demographic, and biomolecular variables were analyzed from anonymized clinical records. The k-prototypes algorithm was applied to cluster patients into groups based on shared characteristics. Subsequently, predictive models using random forest were trained and evaluated through stratified cross-validation and metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. Cox regression was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality and relapse. Results: Four clusters with distinct risk profiles were identified. Overall mortality was 28.8%, and relapse occurred in 40.9%, with a median follow-up time of 8.46 years. The highest-risk group exhibited a mortality rate of 42.3% and a relapse rate of 54.2%, associated with poorer functional status (ECOG ≥3) and a high prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations (71%). The random forest model achieved 80% accuracy in mortality prediction (AUC = 0.78) and 75% accuracy in relapse prediction (AUC = 0.76). Factors such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index, ECOG, BRCA1/2 status, and PD-L1 expression were key determinants in outcome prediction. Discussion: The findings confirm the relevance of machine learning in TNBC stratification. A clinically meaningful classification was achieved, outperforming traditional models based solely on clinical or genomic variables. Comorbid burden and tumor biomarkers played crucial roles in outcome prediction.

Existing statistical and machine learning models often rely on baseline or diagnosis visit data, assume fixed predictor-survival relationships, lack validation in non-Western populations, and depend on features like genetic tests and imaging not routinely available. This study developed ALS mortality prediction models that address these limitations. Methods: We trained Royston-Parmar and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models on the PRO-ACT database for 6- and 12-month mortality predictions. Each visit was labeled positive (for death) if death occurred within 6 or 12 months, negative if survival was confirmed beyond that, and excluded if follow-up was insufficient, assuming patients were alive up to their last recorded visit. Models were validated on independent datasets from the North American Celecoxib trial and a Singapore ALS clinic population. Feature importance and the impact of reducing predictors on performance were evaluated. Results: Models predicted mortality from any clinical visit with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.768–0.819, rising to 0.865 for 12-month prediction using 3-month windows. Albumin was the top predictor, reflecting nutritional and inflammatory status. Other key predictors included ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised slope, limb onset, absolute basophil count, forced vital capacity, bicarbonate, body mass index, and respiratory rate. Models maintained robust performance on the independent datasets and after reducing inputs to seven key predictors. Discussion: These visit-agnostic models, validated across diverse populations, identify key prognostic features and demonstrate the potential of predictive modeling to enhance ALS care and trial design. © 2025 The Author(s).

This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based prediction model for 28-day mortality in AKI patients with liver cirrhosis using the MIMIC-IV database. Methods This retrospective study analyzed data from 4,168 AKI patients, including 601 with concurrent liver cirrhosis, from the MIMIC-IV database. Patient selection followed strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study implemented comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature normalization and selection through Recursive Feature Elimination. Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated, with model performance assessed through ROC curves, calibration curves, and precision-recall analysis. SHAP analysis was conducted to interpret feature contributions to mortality prediction. Results The liver cirrhosis group demonstrated distinct clinical characteristics, including significantly lower age (median 60 vs 70 years, p < 0.001) and higher disease severity scores (SOFA 11 vs 8 points) compared to non-cirrhotic patients. Survival analysis confirmed significantly lower 28-day survival probability in the cirrhosis group (Log-rank test, χ2 = 46.5, p < 0.001). The Random Forest model achieved optimal performance with an AUC of 0.85 and precision-recall area of 0.81. SHAP analysis identified pH, anion gap, and total CO2 as the most significant predictive factors, with notable interaction effects among these indicators. Conclusion This study successfully developed a machine learning model for predicting 28-day mortality in AKI patients with liver cirrhosis. The model demonstrated superior clinical decision-making value compared to traditional scoring systems, particularly in moderate-risk threshold intervals. The findings emphasize the crucial role of acid-base balance indicators in mortality risk assessment, providing valuable insights for clinical intervention strategies. © 2025 Chai et al.

This study aimed to develop a method for improved prediction of hip fracture by incorporating measurements of bone microstructure and composition derived from HR-pQCT. In a prospective cohort study of 3028 community-dwelling women aged 75-80, all participants answered questionnaires and underwent baseline examinations of anthropometrics and bone by DXA and HR-pQCT. Medical records, a regional x-ray archive, and registers were used to identify incident fractures and death. Prediction models for hip, major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), and any fracture were developed using Cox proportional hazards regression and machine learning algorithms (neural network, random forest, ensemble, and Extreme Gradient Boosting). In the 2856 (94.3%) women with complete HR-pQCT data at 2 tibia sites (distal and ultra-distal), the median follow-up period was 8.0 yr, and 217 hip, 746 MOF, and 1008 any type of incident fracture occurred. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, BMI, clinical risk factors (CRFs), and FN BMD, the strongest predictors of hip fracture were tibia total volumetric BMD and cortical thickness. The performance of the Cox regression-based prediction models for hip fracture was significantly improved by HR-pQCT (time-dependent AUC; area under receiver operating characteristic curve at 5 yr of follow-up 0.75 [0.64-0.85]), compared to a reference model including CRFs and FN BMD (AUC = 0.71 [0.58-0.81], p <. 001) and a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool risk score model (AUC = 0.70 [0.60-0.80], p <. 001). The Cox regression model for hip fracture had a significantly higher accuracy than the neural network-based model, the best-performing machine learning algorithm, at clinically relevant sensitivity levels. We conclude that the addition of HR-pQCT parameters improves the prediction of hip fractures in a cohort of older Swedish women. © 2025 The Author(s).","39869791","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The VAI employed deep learning to extract CXR features and a Cox proportional hazard model to generate a hazard score (“CXR-risk”). We retrospectively collected CXRs from patients visited outpatient department and physical examination center. Subsequently, we reviewed mortality and morbidity outcomes from electronic medical records. The dataset consisted of 41,945, 10,492, 31,707, and 4441 patients in the training, validation, internal test, and external test sets, respectively. During the median follow-up of 3.2 (IQR, 1.2–6.1) years of both internal and external test sets, the “CXR-risk” demonstrated C-indexes of 0.859 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.851–0.867) and 0.870 (95% CI, 0.844–0.896), respectively. Patients with high “CXR-risk,” above 85th percentile, had a significantly higher risk of mortality than those with low risk, below 50th percentile. The addition of clinical and laboratory data and radiographic report further improved the predictive accuracy, resulting in C-indexes of 0.888 and 0.900. The VAI can provide accurate predictions of mortality and morbidity outcomes using just a single CXR, and it can complement other risk prediction indicators to assist physicians in assessing patient risk more effectively. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine 2024.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study is the first and most comprehensive work applying machine learning to address this need while seeking to offer a transformative approach to integrating AI into palliative care decision-making. The objective is to predict survival in elderly individuals six months post-admission to residential aged care facilities with patient-level interpretability for transparency and support for clinical decision-making for palliative care options. Methods: Data from 11,944 residents across 40 facilities, with a novel combination of 18 features was used to develop predictive models, comparing standard approaches like Cox Proportional Hazards, Ridge and Lasso Regression with machine learning algorithms, Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Survival Forest. Model calibration was performed together with ROC and a suite of evaluation metrics to analyze results. Explainable AI (XAI) tools were used to demonstrate both the cohort-level and patient-level model interpretability to enable transparency in the clinical usage of the models. TRIPOD reporting guidelines were followed, with model parameters and code provided publicly. Results: GB was the top performer with a Dynamic AUROC of 0.746 and a Concordance Index of 0.716 for six-month survival prediction. Explainable AI tools provided insights into key features such as comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and nutritional status, revealing their impact on survival outcomes and interactions that inform clinical decision-making. The calibrated model showed near-optimal performance with adjustable clinically relevant thresholds. The integration of XAI tools proved effective in enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of predictions, offering actionable insights that support informed and ethically responsible end-of-life (EoL) care decisions in aged care settings. Conclusion: This study successfully applied machine learning to create viable survival models for aged care residents, demonstrating their usability for clinical settings via a suite of interpretable tools.

We aimed to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to obtain volumetric measurements of chest body composition from CTAC scans and to evaluate these measures for all-cause mortality risk stratification. Methods: We applied AI-based segmentation and image-processing techniques on CTAC scans from a large international image-based registry at four sites (Yale University, University of Calgary, Columbia University, and University of Ottawa), to define the chest rib cage and multiple tissues. Volumetric measures of bone, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue, intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) were quantified between automatically identified T5 and T11 vertebrae. The independent prognostic value of volumetric attenuation and indexed volumes were evaluated for predicting all-cause mortality, adjusting for established risk factors and 18 other body composition measures via Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier curves. Findings: The end-to-end processing time was less than 2 min per scan with no user interaction. Between 2009 and 2021, we included 11 305 participants from four sites participating in the REFINE SPECT registry, who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography cardiac scans. After excluding patients who had incomplete T5–T11 scan coverage, missing clinical data, or who had been used for EAT model training, the final study group comprised 9918 patients. 5451 (55%) of 9918 participants were male and 4467 (45%) of 9918 participants were female. Median follow-up time was 2·48 years (IQR 1·46−3·65), during which 610 (6%) patients died. High VAT, EAT, and IMAT attenuation were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio 2·39, 95% CI 1·92–2·96; p<0·0001, 1·55, 1·26–1·90; p<0·0001, and 1·30, 1·06–1·60; p=0·012, respectively). Patients with high bone attenuation were at reduced risk of death (0·77, 0·62–0·95; p=0·016). Likewise, high skeletal muscle volume index was associated with a reduced risk of death (0·56, 0·44–0·71; p<0·0001). Interpretation: CTAC scans obtained routinely during cardiac perfusion imaging contain important volumetric body composition biomarkers that can be automatically measured and offer important additional prognostic value.

Although red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is recognized as a potential prognostic biomarker, its variations during ICU admission and its interaction with treatments such as β-blockers are not well understood across different cardiomyopathy subtypes. To assess the prognostic significance of RDW dynamics and their interaction with β-blocker therapy in predicting 365-day mortality among ICU patients with dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, utilizing longitudinal data and advanced modeling techniques. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 317 cardiomyopathy patients from the MIMIC-IV database. Their RDW dynamics were assessed over their ICU stay. Cox regression (including time-dependent Cox models) and logistic regression identified independent mortality risk factors. Key predictors were identified using Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm. Restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to examine nonlinear relationships. Machine learning models were used to evaluate predictive performance, with SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and tree-based feature selection identifying influential variables. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze RDW trends and β-blocker associations. A Bayesian multivariate joint model (BMJM) integrated RDW dynamics and β-blocker therapy, incorporating repeated measures and survival outcomes. Results: RDW was an independent predictor of 365-day mortality (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01–1.29, p = 0.03), alongside the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00–1.01, p = 0.03), whereas β-blockers significantly reduced mortality risk (HR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1–0.39, p < 0.001). Comparative analysis demonstrated that RDW exhibited greater predictive value over the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and SII. Machine learning identified logistic classification as the best predictive model (AUC = 0.811), with SHAP and tree-based selection confirming RDW and β-blockers as key predictors. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between RDW and β-blocker use (F = 6.65, p < 0.0001), with β-blockers lowering RDW levels. The BMJM demonstrated strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.80). The patient-specific BMJM indicated that discontinuing β-blockers increased the risk of mortality, while initiating β-blockers reduced it. Conclusions: This study highlights dynamic RDW monitoring and β-blocker therapy as strong predictors of 365-day mortality in ICU-admitted cardiomyopathy patients. The BMJM enables personalized risk assessment by integrating longitudinal biomarker data. These findings support RDW as a dynamic biomarker and advocate for its integration into personalized treatment strategies. © 2025 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Clinical data for GPA patients were extracted from the MIMIC-IV (version 3.0) database. Logistic and Cox regression analyses, Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis, and mediation effect analysis were used to assess the association between AKI, renal function indicators, and 1-year mortality in GPA patients. Predictive models were constructed using machine learning algorithms, and tree-based feature selection was applied to evaluate the contributions of AKI and renal function indicators to mortality prediction. A total of 127 GPA patients were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression identified AKI (OR > 1, P < 0.05) as a significant predictor of 1-year mortality. Similarly, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed AKI (HR > 1, P < 0.05) as an independent risk factor for 1-year mortality. KM survival analysis demonstrated that GPA patients with AKI had significantly lower survival rates than those without AKI (P < 0.0001). Additionally, renal function indicators modestly mediated the relationship between AKI and 1-year mortality in GPA patients. The machine learning analysis indicated that the random forest algorithm performed the best, with an area under the curve of 0.894. Feature selection using tree model analysis highlighted both AKI and renal function indicators as significant contributors to mortality prediction in GPA patients. Our study suggested AKI was an independent risk factor for increased 1-year mortality in GPA patients. Additionally, renal function indicators partially mediated the relationship between AKI and 1-year mortality in these patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.","40266362","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We aim to develop and externally validate a new predictive score (the Geriatric Cancer Scoring System [GCSS]) to refine individualized prognosis for older patients with cancer during the first year after a geriatric assessment (GA).MATERIALS AND METHODSData were collected from two French prospective multicenter cohorts of patients with cancer 70 years and older, referred for GA: ELCAPA (training set January 2007-March 2016) and ONCODAGE (validation set August 2008-March 2010). Candidate predictors included baseline oncologic and geriatric factors and routine biomarkers. We built predictive models using Cox regression, single decision tree (DT), and random survival forest (RSF) methods, comparing their predictive performance for 3-, 6-, and 12-month mortalities by computing time-dependent area under the receiver operator curve (tAUC).RESULTSA total of 2,012 and 1,397 patients were included in the training and validation set, respectively (mean age: 81 ± 6 years/78 ± 5 years; women: 47%/70%; metastatic cancer: 50%/34%; 12-month mortality: 43%/16%). Tumor site/metastatic status, cancer treatment, weight loss, ≥five prescription drugs, impaired functional status and mobility, abnormal G-8 score, low creatinine clearance, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin were identified as relevant predictors in the Cox model. DT and RSF identified more complex combinations of features, with G-8 score, tumor site/metastatic status, and CRP/albumin ratio contributing most to the predictions. The RSF approach gave the highest tAUC (12 months: 0.87 [RSF], 0.82 [Cox], 0.82 [DT]) and was retained as the final model.CONCLUSIONThe GCSS on the basis of a machine learning approach applied to two large French cohorts gave an accurate externally validated mortality prediction. The GCSS might improve decision making and counseling in older patients with cancer referred for pretherapeutic GA. GCSS's generalizability must now be confirmed in an international setting. © American Society of Clinical Oncology.","39854651","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study aims to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for predicting 28-day mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on elderly neurocritical ill patients with ICU stays ≥ 24 h. The cohort was split into 70 % for training and 30 % for internal validation. We analyzed 58 variables, including demographics, vital signs, medications, lab results, comorbidities, and medical scores, using Lasso regression to identify predictors of 28-day mortality. Seven ML algorithms were evaluated, and the best model was validated with data from Guizhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital. A log-rank test was used to assess survival differences in Kaplan-Meier curves. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the best model, while subgroup analysis identified variations in model performance across different populations. Results: The study included 1,773 elderly neurocritically ill patients, with a 28-day mortality rate of 28.6 %. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) outperformed other models, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.896 in internal validation and 0.812 in external validation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher LightGBM prediction scores correlated with lower survival probabilities. Key predictors identified through SHAP analysis included partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<inf>2</inf>), Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), white blood cell count, age, and lactate. The LightGBM model demonstrated consistent performance across various subgroups. Conclusions: The LightGBM model effectively predicts 28-day mortality risk in elderly neurocritically ill patients, aiding clinicians in management and resource allocation. Its reliable performance across diverse subgroups underscores its clinical utility. © 2025 The Author(s)","39799642","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We enrolled 1,748 adult venoarterial (VA)-ECMO patients at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 2010 and 2021. The overall mortality rate was 68.2%. Machine learning with the random survival forest (RSF) model demonstrated superior prediction for in-hospital mortality (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.953, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.925-0.981), outperforming the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA; 0.753 [0.689-0.817]), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II (0.737 [0.672-0.802]), Survival after Venoarterial ECMO (SAVE; 0.624 [0.551-0.697]), ENCOURAGE (0.675 [0.606-0.743]), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) III (0.604 [0.533-0.675]) scores. Failure to achieve 25% clearance at 8 hours and 50% at 16 hours significantly increased mortality risk (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.27-2.14, p < 0.001; HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.54, p = 0.035). Based on the RSF-derived variable importance, the RESCUE-24 Score was developed, assigning points for lactic acid clearance (10 for <50% at 16 hours, 6 for <25% at 8 hours), SvO2 <75% (3 points), oliguria <500 ml (2 points), and age ≥60 years (2 points). Patients were classified into low risk (0-2), medium risk (3-20), and high risk (≥21). The medium- and high-risk groups exhibited significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared with the low-risk group (HR: 1.93 [1.46-2.55] and 5.47 [4.07-7.35], p < 0.002, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that improved lactic acid clearance at 8 and 16 hours was associated with better survival (log-rank p < 0.001). The three groups of the RESCUE-24 Score also showed significant survival differences (log-rank p < 0.001). In conclusion, machine learning can help identify high-risk populations for tailored management. Achieving optimal lactic acid clearance within 24 hours is crucial for improving survival outcomes. © © 2025 The Author(s).","39977355","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Machine-learning algorithms have shown potential in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with OSA. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a machine-learning algorithm for predicting 10-and 15-year all-cause mortality in patients with OSA. Methods Patients with OSA were stratified into deceased and alive groups based on mortality outcomes. Various sleep-related features were analyzed, including objective sleep measures and the heart-rate variability during various sleep stages. The light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm was employed to construct a risk-stratification model. The predictive performance of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting mortality over 10 and 15 years. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier plots and Cox proportional-hazards model. Results This study found that parasympathetic activity was higher in OSA patients with worse outcomes than in those with better outcomes. The LGBM-based prediction model with sleep-related features was moderately accurate, with a mean AUC of 0.806 for predicting 10-and 15-year mortality. Furthermore, survival analysis demonstrated that LGBM could significantly distinguish the high-and low-risk groups, as evidenced by Kaplan–Meier plots and Cox regression results. Conclusions This study has confirmed the potential of sleep-related feature analysis and the LGBM algorithm for evaluating the mortality risk in OSA patients. The developed risk-stratification model offers an efficient and interpretable tool for clinicians that emphasizes the significance of patient-specific autonomic responses in mortality prediction.

However, existing severity scores (e.g., SAPS III, SOFA) poorly capture AAA-specific mortality predictors. We aimed to develop a focused prognostic tool to improve short-term risk stratification in ICU-admitted AAA patients. Objective: To develop and validate a machine learning-based nomogram model using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV; 2008-2019) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD; 2014-2015) for early mortality prediction (≤7 days) in critically ill patients with AAA, addressing limitations of conventional ICU scoring systems by integrating AAA-specific predictors and ensuring generalizability through external validation. Methods: Using two independent datasets from MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, we identified patients with AAA with complete ICU records and lab data within 24 hours of admission. Critical predictors were selected via a dual approach: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to eliminate collinearity and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to rank feature importance. MIMIC-IV served as the training dataset, while eICU-CRD was used for external validation. A Cox regression-based nomogram was constructed using the training set and tested for 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortality prediction. Model performance was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC), concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Results: Six key variables independently predicted mortality including age, sepsis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), antihypertensive drug use, average percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and anion gap. The nomogram demonstrated optimal predictive accuracy for 7-day mortality (AUC: 0.730 [training] and 0.718 [validation]; C-indices: 0.717 and 0.731), with reduced performance for 14-day and 28-day outcomes. Calibration curves displayed strong agreement at both 7 and 14 days, and DCA indicated that the model provides significant clinical value. External validation in eICU-CRD mirrored these trends (7-day AUC: 0.723), supporting model generalizability. Conclusion: This multicohort-derived nomogram provides a simple yet reliable tool to predict early mortality (≤7 days) in critically ill AAA patients, which may guide time-sensitive interventions in critical care settings. © The author(s).","41399368","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Methods: This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40–87 years) with diagnosed T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients (36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results: The extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated the best predictive performance.

However, existing models are based on limited clinical parameters and have not thoroughly integrated morbidity and mortality data. Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a novel transformer-based model, referred to as the BA – CA gap model, for BA estimation that incorporates morbidity and mortality information to improve predictive accuracy and enhance clinical use in the early identification of the risk of age-related diseases. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 151,281 adults aged 18 years or older who underwent routine health checkups between 2003 and 2020. Participants were classified into normal, predisease, and disease groups based on comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) to evaluate the model’s ability to discriminate health status along a clinically relevant spectrum. Variables with less than 50% missingness had missing values imputed using the mean, while features with 50% or more missingness were excluded. We develop a custom transformer architecture that learns multiple objectives simultaneously, including input feature reconstruction, BA and CA alignment, health status discrimination, and mortality prediction. Model training used unsupervised and self-supervised strategies. We compared our model’s performance with conventional BA estimation approaches, including Klemera and Doubal’s method, a CA cluster-based model, and a deep neural network, by examining BA gap distributions, health status stratification, and mortality prediction. Results: The proposed BA – CA gap model provided a more accurate reflection of health status and superior stratification of mortality risk than existing methods. The model effectively distinguished among normal, predisease, and disease groups, with a clear gradient of BA gap values. Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated stronger discrimination of future mortality in men, while a similar but not statistically significant trend was observed in women. Sensitivity analyses across multiple random splits and training subsets confirmed the robustness of the model’s performance. Conclusions: By integrating morbidity and mortality information within a transformer-based framework, the BA – CA gap model offers a more granular and clinically meaningful assessment of aging and health status than CA alone. This approach supports the potential for personalized health management and risk stratification, although external validation in diverse populations is warranted to further confirm its generalizability. © Seong-Eun Moon, Ji Won Yoon, Jae Hyun Bae, Shinyoung Joo, Yoo Hyung Kim, Bon Hyang Lee, Seokho Yoon, Haanju Yoo, Young Min Cho.","40930058","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Competing risks analysis (CRA), which account for such terminal events, offers more accurate estimates. However, its application in a web-based health analytics remains limited. Methods: Using a simulated cohort (n = 2,500; 100 repetitions) and the 1999–2000 NHANES cohort (n = 2,480) with 2019 National Death Index mortality linkage, the researcher compared KM estimates to CRA’s Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF), implemented via Aalen-Johansen estimators and Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models. We assessed relative differences (bias) in 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year cardiovascular mortality predictions across risk strata. Findings informed a web-based calculator prototype that dynamically estimates age-specific KM and CIF probabilities while highlighting potential misclassification risks. Results: KM consistently overestimated cardiovascular mortality risk compared to CIF. In the NHANES cohort, KM estimated the 5-year risk to be 5.85% higher than the actual rate (4.37% vs. 4.13%) and 20-year risk by 28.3% (20.02% vs. 15.60%). In the simulated data, KM overestimated the 5-year risk by 7.63% (5.84% vs. 5.42%) and the 20-year risk by 31.17% (21.37% vs. 16.25%). KM-based models tend to misclassify a substantial portion of patients into higher-risk groups compared to CIF-adjusted models. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that Kaplan-Meier consistently overestimates cardiovascular mortality in comparison to competing risk methods across five time points, through using both simulated and nationally representative data. We quantify this overestimation and provide an online calculator that shows differences by age. Our tool improves the usability and interpretability of competing risks analysis for older adults in digital health settings, in contrast to tools like SCORE2. © 2025 Mohammad Zaino.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Accurately predicting the mortality risk of older adults with SP is essential for informed clinical decision-making. This study aims to utilize machine learning techniques that incorporate sociodemographic factors, health-related metrics, lifestyle variables, and biomarker data to improve risk stratification and management in older adults with SP. Methods: We analyzed data from the NHANES from 1999–2006 and 2010–2018, including a total of 1,619 older adult patients with SP, with a 10-year follow-up period for this population, during which 541 (33%) patients died and 1,078 (67%) survived. This study extracted 36 clinical variables for each patient, encompassing sociodemographic factors, health-related metrics, and biochemical markers. Feature selection was performed using Lasso Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest machine learning algorithms, and a nomogram model was developed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, with validation of its accuracy, concordance, and clinical applicability. Results: A total of 12 feature variables were identified through the combined use of three machine learning methods. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified Age, Height, Neutrophil count (NENO), The ratio of hemoglobin to red cell distribution width (HRR), Uric Acid (UA), and Creatinine as significant predictors of mortality in older adults with SP, and a nomogram model was constructed based on these feature variables, with model performance assessed through discrimination, calibration curves, and clinical utility evaluation. The model achieved AUC values of 0.753, 0.773, 0.782, and 0.800 at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively, demonstrating good concordance and adequate calibration. Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the model had broad applicability in predicting short-term and long-term outcomes in older adult patients with SP. Finally, based on the nomogram risk score, patients were stratified into risk groups and survival curves were plotted, illustrating a significantly lower survival probability in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, we developed and validated a prognostic model for SP in the older adult that integrates multimodal data, enhancing predictive accuracy and reliability. This model provides valuable insights for clinicians, facilitates risk stratification, and provides personalized interventions for older adults with SP. © © 2025 Liu, Guo, Peng and Wu.","40852657","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of these biomarkers by determining the association between adipose tissue measures and all-cause mortality. Methods: This retrospective study included 151,141 patients who underwent abdominal CT for any reason between 2000 and 2021. A validated AI-based algorithm quantified subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue cross-sectional area. A visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (VSR) was calculated. Clinical data (age at the time of CT, sex, date of death, date of last contact) was obtained from a database search of the electronic health record. Hazard ratios (HR) and Kaplan–Meier curves assessed the relationship between adipose tissue measures and mortality. The endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality, with additional subgroup analysis including age and gender. Results: 138,169 patients were included in the final analysis. Higher VSR was associated with increased mortality; this association was strongest in younger women (highest compared to lowest risk quartile HR 3.32 in 18-39y). Lower SAT was associated with increased mortality regardless of sex or age group (HR up to 1.63 in 18-39y). Higher VAT was associated with increased mortality in younger age groups, with the trend weakening and reversing with age; this association was stronger in women. Conclusion: AI-based CT measures of SAT, VAT, and VSR are predictive of mortality, with VSR being the highest performing fat area biomarker overall. These metrics tended to perform better for women and younger patients. Incorporating AI tools can augment patient assessment and management, improving outcome. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, its prognostic value in neurosurgical populations remains unclear. This study investigated the association between postoperative GV and mortality following craniotomy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,969 adult ICU patients who underwent cranial surgery. GV was measured using both CV and rMSSD calculated from blood glucose values during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality; the secondary outcome was 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression, restricted cubic splines, threshold effect analysis, and mediation analysis via blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were conducted. A Random Survival Forest (RSF) model was developed using machine learning and interpreted with SHAP values. Results: Higher GV, as reflected by both elevated CV and rMSSD, was independently associated with increased 28-day and 90-day mortality (CV per 10-unit HR: 1.20; rMSSD per 10-unit HR: 1.02; all P < 0.01). BUN partially mediated the association between GV and mortality. GV outperformed traditional clinical scores (SOFA, GCS, CCI) in ROC analysis (CV AUC = 0.72). The RSF model achieved an AUC of 0.841 and identified GV metrics as top predictors. Conclusions: Postoperative glycemic variability, assessed by CV and rMSSD, is an independent and modifiable predictor of short- and mid-term mortality following craniotomy. These findings highlight the clinical importance of GV in postoperative risk stratification and support its integration into neurosurgical critical care. © © 2025 Ge, Wang, Huang and Zhang.","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

We refined the model by selecting the top 10 most influential factors and compared its performance with the original model. Additionally, we conducted external validation using an independent in-house dataset. Among the 29,364 patients, 4,729 (16.1%) died within 1 year, while 24,635 survived. The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model achieved the highest performance (AUC: 0.958, accuracy: 0.949).

Specifically, the indicators examined include the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), along with its derived metrics: TyG-BMI, TyG-WHtR, TyG-WWI, TyG-WC, lipid accumulation product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and abdominal obesity index (ABSI), resulting in a total of eight indicators. Methods: This study utilizes data from the NHANES conducted from 1999 to 2018, analyzing a cohort of 4,058 patients diagnosed with diabetes/prediabetes. We utilized multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate the impact of these indicators on both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates. Additionally, we compared the predictive performance of eight machine learning (ML) algorithms regarding mortality risk and used the SHAP method to clarify the significance of obesity and lipid-related indicators in mortality prediction. Results: The results of the multivariable Cox regression analysis reveal significant associations between TyG, TyG-WWI, and ABSI with all-cause mortality among patients with diabetes/prediabetes. Compared to baseline levels, the HR for TyG in the fourth quartile (Q4) was 1.49, while for TyG-WWI (Q4), the HR was 1.52. Furthermore, ABSI was associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in groups Q3 and Q4, presenting risk ratios of 1.80 and 1.68, respectively. Notably, TyG (Q4) was also significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality risk, with an HR of 1.98. RCS analysis indicated a linear trend between TyG, TyG-WWI, and all-cause mortality, whereas ABSI displayed a non-linear trend. Among the ML algorithms evaluated, the XGBoost model exhibited the strongest predictive capability. The SHAP analysis indicated that the indicators with the greatest impact on all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes/prediabetes were ranked as follows: TyG > ABSI > TyG-WWI. Furthermore, sex-based subgroup analysis indicated that VAI was positively associated with cardiovascular mortality in male patients with diabetes/prediabetes, exhibiting a linear trend. Conclusion: TyG, TyG-WWI, ABSI, and VAI are closely linked to mortality risk in diabetes/prediabetes patients. Among these, TyG is significantly associated with both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, showing superior predictive capability. We recommend long-term monitoring of these indicators and their inclusion in management strategies to effectively inform diabetes/prediabetes patients about their mortality risks. © © 2025 Yan, Chang, Liu, Liu and Du.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, incomplete data significantly limits the size of the beneficiary patient population in clinical practice. Using advanced artificial intelligence methods, the authors developed a robust mortality prediction model with APP from incomplete data. METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated the patients with IAH from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Incomplete data were filled in using generative adversarial imputation nets (GAIN). Lastly, demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were combined to build a 7-day mortality prediction model. RESULTS: The authors included 1354 patients in this study, of which 63 features were extracted. Data imputation with GAIN achieved the best performance. Patients with an APP <60 mmHg had significantly higher all-cause mortality within 7-90 days. The difference remained significant in long-term survival even after propensity score matching (PSM) eliminated other mortality risks between groups. Lastly, the built machine learning model for 7-day modality prediction achieved the best results with an AUC of 0.80 in patients with confirmed IAH outperforming the other four traditional clinical scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: APP reduction is an important survival predictor affecting the survival prognosis of patients with IAH. The authors constructed a robust model to predict the 7-day mortality probability of patients with IAH, which is superior to the commonly used clinical scoring systems. © © 2024 The Author(s).

Synthetic data - artificially generated patient records designed to mirror real-world distributions - offers a potential solution. We hypothesized that diffusion models, a state-of-the-art generative technique, could produce synthetic liver transplant waitlist data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database that maintains statistical fidelity, replicates clinical correlations and survival patterns, and ensures robust privacy protection. Methods: Diffusion models were used to generate synthetic patient cohorts mirroring the UNOS liver transplant waitlist database between years 2019 and 2023. Statistical fidelity was assessed using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Wasserstein distance, correlation analysis, and variable-level metrics. Clinical utility was evaluated by comparing transplant-free survival via Kaplan-Meier curves and the MELD score performance. Privacy was quantified using the Distance to Closest Record (DCR) and attribute disclosure risk assessments. Results: The synthetic dataset was nearly indistinguishable from the original dataset (MMD=0.002, standardized Wasserstein distance<1.0), preserving clinically relevant correlations and survival patterns as evidenced by similar median survival times (110 vs. 101 days) and 5-year survival rates (22.2% vs. 22.8%). MELD-based 90-day mortality prediction was maintained (original AUC=0.839 vs. synthetic AUC=0.844). Privacy metrics indicated no identifiable patient matches, and mean DCR values ensured that synthetic individuals were not direct replicas of real patients. Conclusion: AI-generated synthetic data derived from diffusion models can faithfully replicate complex hepatology datasets, maintain key clinical signals, and ensure strong privacy safeguards.

This study aimed to quantify the effect sizes of risk factors on mortality using various machine learning approaches. A cohort of 3284 HD patients from the CRC-ESRD (2008–2014) was analyzed. Mortality risk models were validated using logistic regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and decision trees, as well as ensemble methods like bagging and random forest. To better handle missing data and time-series variables, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an autoencoder was also developed. Additionally, survival models predicting hazard ratios were employed using survival analysis techniques. The analysis included 1750 prevalent and 1534 incident HD patients (mean age 58.4 ± 13.6 years, 59.3% male). Over a median follow-up of 66.2 months, the overall mortality rate was 19.3%. Random forest models achieved an AUC of 0.8321 for first-year mortality prediction, which was further improved by the RNN with autoencoder (AUC 0.8357). The survival bagging model had the highest hazard ratio predictability (C-index 0.7756). A shorter dialysis duration (< 14.9 months) and high modified Charlson comorbidity index scores (7–9) were associated with hazard ratios up to 7.76 (C-index 0.7693). Comorbidities were more influential than age in predicting early mortality. Monitoring dialysis adequacy (KT/V), RAAS inhibitor use, and urine output is crucial for assessing early prognosis. © The Author(s) 2024.","39609495","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The purpose was to develop a machine learning (ML) model for predicting the 30-day all-cause mortality risk in SAP patients and to explain the most important predictors. Methods: This research utilized six ML methods, including logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors(KNN), support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), random forests(RF), and extreme gradient boosting(XGBoost), to construct six predictive models for SAP. An extensive evaluation was conducted to determine the most effective model and then the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to visualize key variables. Utilizing the optimized model, stratified predictions were made for patients with SAP. Further, the study employed multivariable Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, along with subgroup analysis, to explore the relationship between the machine learning-based score and 30-day mortality. Results: Through LASSO regression and recursive feature elimination (RFE), 25 optimal feature variables are selected. The XGBoost model performed best, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881, a sensitivity of 0.5714, a specificity of 0.9651 and an F1 score of 0.64. The first six most important feature variables were the use of vasopressor, high Charlson comorbidity index, low blood oxygen saturation, history of malignant tumor, hyperglycemia and high APSIII score. Based on the optimal threshold of 0.62, patients were divided into high and low-risk groups, and the 30-day survival rate in the high-risk group decreased significantly. COX regression analysis further confirmed the positive correlation between high-risk scores and 30-day mortality. In the subgroup analysis, the model showed good risk stratification ability in patients with different gender, renal replacement therapy and with or without a history of malignant tumor, but it was not effective in predicting peripheral vascular disease. Conclusions: the XGBoost model effectively predicts the severity of SAP, serving as a valuable tool for clinicians to identify SAP early. © The Author(s) 2024.","39501235","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Despite the need for accurate prognosis in this demographic, existing studies primarily focus on broader age groups, often using the SEER database, which has limitations in variable selection. This study aimed to develop an ML-based model to predict survival outcomes in young BC patients using the BC public staging database. A total of 3,401 patients with BC were included in the study. Patients were categorized as younger (n = 1574) and older (n = 1827). We applied several survival models—Random Survival Forest, Gradient Boosting Survival, Extra Survival Trees (EST), and penalized Cox models (Lasso and ElasticNet)—to compare mortality characteristics. The EST model outperformed others in predicting mortality for both age groups. Older patients exhibited a higher prevalence of comorbidities compared to younger patients. Tumor stage was the primary variable used to train the model for mortality prediction in both groups. COPD was a significant variable only in younger patients with BC. Other variables exhibited varying degrees of consistency in each group. These findings can help identify high-risk young female patients with BC who require aggressive treatment by predicting the risk of mortality. © The Author(s) 2024.","39468113","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, its application to the growing repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) population remains unexplored. Objectives: This study aimed to develop and externally validate an AI-ECG model to predict 5-year mortality in rTOF. Methods: A convolutional neural network was trained on electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained at Boston Children's Hospital and tested on Boston (internal testing) and Toronto (external validation) INDICATOR (International Multicenter TOF Registry) cohorts to predict 5-year mortality. Model performance was evaluated on single ECGs per patient using area under the receiver operating (AUROC) and precision recall (AUPRC) curves. Results: The internal testing and external validation cohorts comprised of 1,054 patients (13,077 ECGs at median age 17.8 [Q1-Q3: 7.9-30.5] years; 54% male; 6.1% mortality) and 335 patients (5,014 ECGs at median age 38.3 [Q1-Q3: 29.1-48.7] years; 57% male; 8.4% mortality), respectively. Model performance was similar during internal testing (AUROC 0.83, AUPRC 0.18) and external validation (AUROC 0.81, AUPRC 0.21). AI-ECG performed similarly to the biventricular global function index (an imaging biomarker) and outperformed QRS duration. AI-ECG 5-year mortality prediction, but not QRS duration, was a significant independent predictor when added into a Cox regression model with biventricular global function index to predict shorter time-to-death on internal and external cohorts. Saliency mapping identified QRS fragmentation, wide and low amplitude QRS complexes, and flattened T waves as high-risk features. Conclusions: This externally validated AI-ECG model may complement imaging biomarkers to improve risk stratification in patients with rTOF. © 2024 American College of Cardiology Foundation","39297841","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Methods: The data for this study were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 6772 participants without heart failure, for the years 1999 to 2004. Multivariable Cox regression models, cubic spline restricted models and Kaplan–Meier curves were used to evaluate the relationship between NTproBNP and both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Predictive models were established using seven machine learning methods, and evaluation was conducted using precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) values. Results: During the population follow-up, out of 6772 participants, 1554 died, with 365 deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease. After adjusting for relevant covariates, NTproBNP levels ≥300 pg/mL were positively associated with both all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.48, 3.67) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 6.05, 95% CI 3.67, 9.97), and remained significant across different body mass index (BMI) strata. However, in participants without abdominal obesity, the correlation between NTproBNP and cardiovascular mortality was significantly reduced. Among the seven machine learning methods, logistic regression demonstrated better predictive performance for both all-cause mortality (AUC 0.86925) and cardiovascular mortality (AUC 0.85115). However, establishing accurate cardiovascular mortality prediction models for non-abdominal obese individuals proved challenging. Conclusion: The study showed that NTproBNP can serve as a predictive factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with different BMIs, including obese individuals. However, significant cardiovascular mortality correlation was observed only for NTproBNP levels ≥300 pg/mL, and only among participants with abdominal obesity. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","39239686","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Recently, a machine learning classifier system, Fibresolve, designed to identify a variety of computed tomography (CT) patterns associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), was demonstrated to have a significant association with mortality across multiple subtypes of ILD. The purpose of this follow-up study was to retrospectively validate these findings in a large, external cohort of patients with ILD. Methods: In this multi-center validation study, Fibresolve was applied to chest CT scans of patients with confirmed ILD that had available follow-up data. Fibresolve scores categorized by tertile were analyzed using Cox regression analysis adjusted for tobacco use and modified GAP (mGAP) score. Results: Of 643 patients included, 446 (69.3%) died over a median follow-up time of 144 [1-821] weeks. The median [range] mGAP score was 5 [3–7].

This study aimed to develop a predictive classification model for breast cancer mortality using real-world data, including various clinical features. Methods: A total of 11,286 patients with breast cancer from the National Cancer Center were included in this study. The mortality rate of the total sample was approximately 6.2%. Propensity score matching was used to reduce bias. Several machine learning models, including extreme gradient boosting, were applied to 31 clinical features. To enhance model interpretability, we used the SHapley Additive exPlanations method. ML analyses were also performed on the samples, excluding patients who developed other cancers after breast cancer. Results: Among the ML models, the XGB model exhibited the highest discriminatory power, with an area under the curve of 0.8722 and a specificity of 0.9472. Key predictors of the mortality classification model included occurrence in other organs, age at diagnosis, N stage, T stage, curative radiation treatment, and Ki-67(%). Even after excluding patients who developed other cancers after breast cancer, the XGB model remained the best-performing, with an AUC of 0.8518 and a specificity of 0.9766. Additionally, the top predictors from SHAP were similar to the results for the overall sample. Conclusions: Our models provided excellent predictions of breast cancer mortality using real-world data from South Korea. Explainable artificial intelligence, such as SHAP, validated the clinical applicability and interpretability of these models. © 2024 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Individual mortality prediction could be of interest to improve individual clinical outcomes. Using an independent regional dataset, the aim of the present study was to externally validate the recently published 2-year all-cause mortality prediction tool developed using machine learning. Methods: A validation dataset of stage 4 or 5 CKD outpatients was used. External validation performance of the prediction tool at the optimal cutoff-point was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. A survival analysis was then performed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: Data of 527 outpatients with stage 4 or 5 CKD were analyzed. During the 2 years of follow-up, 91 patients died and 436 survived. Compared to the learning dataset, patients in the validation dataset were significantly younger, and the ratio of deceased patients in the validation dataset was significantly lower. The performance of the prediction tool at the optimal cutoff-point was: AUC-ROC = 0.72, accuracy = 63.6%, sensitivity = 72.5%, and specificity = 61.7%.

Objective: In the present study, a prediction model combining Survival Analysis, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, under the Machine Learning philosophy, is proposed for the early diagnosis of possible factors causing dropout in university students. Methods: The proposal consists of 3 phases: the Survival Analysis that allows estimating the probability of permanence of the student (survival). Phase 2 starts from the probability value obtained in the previous phase and uses it as a response variable in the modeling process based on Decision Trees to establish survival patterns around the variables considered. Finally, in phase 3, the critical variables in the model are identified using the Random Forest. Results: The proposed methodology allowed the design of a prediction model to identify the main segmentation variables in behavior patterns of possible cases of academic dropout. Conclusion: Even though the proposal was developed considering a particular case of a Chilean university, the efficient combination of metaheuristics allows the extrapolation of the methodology to any context and academic reality. However, the conditions and needs of each institution must be considered. © 2024, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu. All rights reserved.","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

These visual explanations can empower clinicians in early lung cancer detection and increase patient awareness of their susceptibility to the disease. To test this hypothesis, we train a censor-aware multi-class survival prediction deep learning classifier that is robust to imbalanced training, where classes represent quantized number of days for time-to-death prediction. Such multi-class model allows us to use post-hoc interpretability methods, such as Grad-CAM, to localize image regions of preclinical tumors. For the experiments, we propose a new benchmark based on the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) dataset to test weakly-supervised preclinical tumor localization and survival prediction models, and results suggest that our proposed method shows state-of-the-art C-index survival prediction and weakly-supervised preclinical tumor localization results.

Objectives This study aimed to assess whether systematic screening enables identification of novel and registry-specific baseline patient characteristics influencing long-term mortality. Patient and methods Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to screen 42 baseline patient characteristics shared by the SYNTAX (Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) trial and a single-center Polish registry of 1035 consecutive patients with complex CAD who received revascularization and were followed-up for 5 years. After screening, a classic Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the suitability of a linear model for predicting 5-year mortality, which was then compared with the mortality predicted in the same cohort using the SYNTAX score II 2020 (SS2020). Result s The 5-year mortality rate in the registry was 12.3%, and the strongest predictors were pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and insulin-dependent diabetes. In an internal validation, the linear model constructed after LASSO screening and combined with a classic Cox regression analysis improved the prediction of 5-year mortality, as compared with the SS2020 (concordance index of 0.92 and 0.75, respectively). Conclusions A machine learning approach improved the detection of registry-specific risk factors in all-comer patients amenable to surgical or percutaneous revascularization who were evaluated by a heart team. The risk factors identified in RCTs are not necessarily the same as those detected in real clinical practice when systematic screening is applied. © Author(s), 2024.","38742937","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We aim to investigate protein biomarkers’ role in prognosticating outcomes in ICH patients. We assessed 22 protein biomarkers using targeted proteomics in serum samples obtained from the ICH patient dataset (N = 150). We defined poor outcomes as modified Rankin scale score of 3–6. We incorporated clinical variables and protein biomarkers in regression models and random forest-based machine learning algorithms to predict poor outcomes and mortality. We report Odds Ratio (OR) or Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). We used five-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping for internal validation of prediction models. We included 149 patients for 90-day and 144 patients with ICH for 180-day outcome analyses. In multivariable logistic regression, UCH-L1 (adjusted OR 9.23; 95%CI 2.41–35.33), alpha-2-macroglobulin (aOR 5.57; 95%CI 1.26–24.59), and Serpin-A11 (aOR 9.33; 95%CI 1.09–79.94) were independent predictors of 90-day poor outcome; MMP-2 (aOR 6.32; 95%CI 1.82–21.90) was independent predictor of 180-day poor outcome. In multivariable Cox regression models, IGFBP-3 (aHR 2.08; 95%CI 1.24–3.48) predicted 90-day and MMP-9 (aOR 1.98; 95%CI 1.19–3.32) predicted 180-day mortality. Machine learning identified additional predictors, including haptoglobin for poor outcomes and UCH-L1, APO-C1, and MMP-2 for mortality prediction. Overall, random forest models outperformed regression models for predicting 180-day poor outcomes (AUC 0.89), and 90-day (AUC 0.81) and 180-day mortality (AUC 0.81). Serum biomarkers independently predicted short-term poor outcomes and mortality after ICH. Further research utilizing a multi-omics platform and temporal profiling is needed to explore additional biomarkers and refine predictive models for ICH prognosis. ©: © 2024 Misra et al.

In this study, we investigated the associations between nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics biomarkers and aging-related diseases as well as mortality using the UK Biobank dataset. We analyzed NMR samples from approximately 110,000 participants and used multi-head machine learning classification models to predict the incidence of aging-related diseases. Cox regression models were then applied to assess the relevance of NMR biomarkers to the risk of death due to aging-related diseases. Additionally, we conducted survival analyses to evaluate the potential improvements of NMR in predicting survival and identify the biomarkers most strongly associated with negative health outcomes by dividing participants into health, disease, and death groups for all age groups. Our analysis revealed specific metabolomics profiles that were associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, and the most significant biomarker was intermediate density lipoprotein cholesteryl (IDL-CE). In addition, NMR biomarkers could provide additional contributions to relevant mortality risk prediction when combined with conventional risk factors, by improving the C-index from 0.813 to 0.833, with 17 NMR biomarkers significantly contributing to disease-related death, such as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic acid (LA), glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), and omega-3. Moreover, the value of free cholesterol in very large HDL particles (XL-HDL-FC) in the healthy control group demonstrated significantly higher values than the disease and death group across all age groups. This study highlights the potential of NMR metabolomics profiling as a valuable tool for identifying metabolic biomarkers associated with aging-related diseases and mortality risk, which could have practical implications for aging-related disease risk and mortality prediction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association.","37648937","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The main objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of predictive models in predicting both mortality events and the probability of disease recurrence. Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 284 individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2001 and 2017. Demographic and clinical data, including gender, disease stage, age at diagnosis, recurrence status, and treatment details, were meticulously recorded. We rigorously evaluated various predictive models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Random Survival Forests (RSF), Gradient Boosting, mboost, Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN), and Cox regression. Performance metrics, such as sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area), and overall accuracy, were calculated for each model to predict mortality and disease recurrence. The analysis was performed using R version 4.1.3 software and the Python programming language. Results: For mortality prediction, the mboost model demonstrated the highest sensitivity at 96.9% (95% CI: 0.83–0.99) and an ROC area of 0.88. It also exhibited high specificity at 80% (95% CI: 0.59–0.93), a positive predictive value of 86.1% (95% CI: 0.70–0.95), and an overall accuracy of 89% (95% CI: 0.78–0.96). Random Forests showed perfect sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 0.85–1) but had low specificity at 0% (95% CI: 0–0.52) and poor overall accuracy (50%). On the other hand, DLNN had the lowest performance metrics for mortality prediction, with a sensitivity of 24% (95% CI: 0.222–0.268), specificity of 75% (95% CI: 0.73–0.77), and a lower positive predictive value of 42% (95% CI: 0.38–0.45). The Gradient Boosting model showed the best performance in predicting recurrence, achieving perfect sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 0.87–1) and high specificity at 92.9% (95% CI: 0.76–0.99). It also had a high positive predictive value of 93.3% (95% CI: 0.77–0.99). Gradient Boosting, with an ROC area of 96.4%, and mboost, with an ROC area of 75%, demonstrated remarkable performance. DLNN had the lowest performance metrics for recurrence prediction, with sensitivity at 1.75% (95% CI: 0.01–0.02), specificity at 98% (95% CI: 0.97–0.98), and a lower positive predictive value at 52.6% (95% CI: 0.39–0.65). Conclusion: In summary, the mboost model demonstrated outstanding performance in predicting mortality, achieving exceptional results across various evaluation metrics. Random Forests exhibited perfect sensitivity but showed poor specificity and overall accuracy. The DLNN model displayed the lowest performance metrics for mortality prediction. In terms of recurrence prediction, the Gradient Boosting model outperformed other models with perfect sensitivity, high specificity, and positive predictive value. The DLNN model had the lowest performance metrics for recurrence prediction. Overall, the results emphasize the effectiveness of the mboost and Gradient Boosting models in predicting mortality and recurrence in colorectal cancer patients. © 2024 The Authors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

OBJECTIVE To examine the feasibility of machine learning (ML) in discerning mortality risk in FEP and to assess whether such risk predictions can inform pharmacotherapy choices. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prognostic study, Swedish nationwide cohort data (from July 1, 2006, to December 31, 2021) were harnessed for model development and validation. Finnish cohort data (from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2017) were used for external validation. Data analyses were completed between December 2022 and December 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fifty-one nationwide register variables, encompassing demographics and clinical and work-related histories, were subjected to ML to predict future mortality risk. The ML model's performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The comparative effectiveness of pharmacotherapies in patients was assessed and was stratified by the ML model to those with predicted high mortality risk (vs low risk), using the between-individual hazard ratio (HR). The 5 most important variables were then identified and a model was retrained using these variables in the discovery sample. RESULTS This study included 24 052 Swedish participants (20 000 in the discovery sample and 4052 in the validation sample) and 1490 Finnish participants (in the validation sample). Swedish participants had a mean (SD) age of 29.1 (8.1) years, 62.1% were men, and 418 died with 2 years. Finnish participants had a mean (SD) age of 29.7 (8.0) years, 61.7% were men, and 31 died within 2 years. The discovery sample achieved an AUROC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68-0.74) for 2-year mortality prediction. Using the 5 most important variables (ie, the top 10% [substance use comorbidities, first hospitalization duration due to FEP, male sex, prior somatic hospitalizations, and age]), the final model resulted in an AUROC of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63-0.76) in the Swedish sample and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.56-0.78) in the Finnish sample. Individuals with predicted high mortality risk had an elevated 15-year risk in the Swedish sample (HR, 3.77 [95% CI, 2.92-4.88]) and an elevated 20-year risk in the Finnish sample (HR, 3.72 [95% CI, 2.67-5.18]). For those with predicted high mortality risk, long-acting injectable antipsychotics (HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.23-0.88]) and mood stabilizers (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]) were associated with decreased mortality risk. Conversely, for those predicted to survive, only oral aripiprazole (HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.20-0.69]) and risperidone (HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.18-0.82]) were associated with decreased mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prognostic study, an ML-based model was developed and validated to predict mortality risk in FEP.

We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict overt DIC in critically ill colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using clinical features and laboratory indicators. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled consecutive CRC patients admitted to the intensive care unit from January 2018 to December 2023. Four ML algorithms were used to construct predictive models using 5-fold cross-validation. The models’ performance in predicting overt DIC and 30-day mortality was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and Cox regression analysis. The performance of three established scoring systems, ISTH DIC-2001, ISTH DIC-2018, and JAAM DIC, was also assessed for survival prediction and served as benchmarks for model comparison. Results: A total of 2,766 patients were enrolled, with 699 (25.3%) diagnosed with overt DIC according to ISTH DIC-2001, 1,023 (36.9%) according to ISTH DIC-2018, and 662 (23.9%) according to JAAM DIC. The extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model outperformed others in DIC prediction (ROC-AUC: 0.848; 95% CI: 0.818–0.878; p < 0.01) and mortality prediction (ROC-AUC: 0.708; 95% CI: 0.646–0.768; p < 0.01). The three DIC scores predicted 30-day mortality with ROC-AUCs of 0.658 for ISTH DIC-2001, 0.692 for ISTH DIC-2018, and 0.673 for JAAM DIC.

Objective: We sought to develop and validate a risk assessment system for the prediction of mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure. Methods: Personalized risk prediction system of mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure was developed. For developing a prediction system with death as the outcome, there were 965 patients (70%) and 413 patients (30%) were included in the the derivation cohort and the validation cohort. For developing a prediction system with rehospitalization for heart failure as the outcome, there were 927 patients (70%) and 398 patients (30%) were included in the derivation cohort and the validation cohort. There were 42 routine clinical variables used to develop the models. The performance evaluation of the model is based on the area under the curve (AUC). Evaluate the improvement with Euro Score II according to NRI and IDI net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results: The median follow-up time was 685 days, the incidence of death was 3.85% (n = 53), and the incidence of rehospitalization for heart failure was 10.01% (n = 138). The AUC values of the mortality prediction model in the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.825 (0.764–0.886) and 0.808 (0.699–0.917), respectively. The AUC values of the rehospitalization for heart failure prediction model in the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.794 (0.756–0.832) and 0.812 (0.758–0.866), respectively. NRI and IDI showed that the mortality prediction model exhibited superior performance than the Euro Score II. The mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure risk prediction models effectively stratified patients into different risk subgroups. Conclusion: The developed and validated models exhibit satisfactory performance in prediction of all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure after mitral valve repair surgery.

We want to use explainable machine learning to learn the feature importance of the patients and identify the subgroup of the patients who may benefit from the PMRT. Additionally, develop tools to provide guidance to the doctors. Methods: In this study, we trained and validated 2 machine learning survival models: deep learning neural network and Cox proportional hazard model. The training dataset consisted of 35,347 patients with HR+/HER2- T1-2 N1M0 breast cancer who received mastectomies from the SEER database from 2013 to 2018. The performance of survival models were assessed using a concordance index (c-index).Then we did subgroup analysis to identify the subgroup who could benefit from PMRT. We also analyzed the global feature importance for the model and individual feature importance for individual survival prediction. Finally, we developed a Cloud-based recommendation system for PMRT to visualize the survival curve of each treatment plan and deployed it on the Internet. Results: A total of 35,347 patients were included in this study. We identified that radiotherapy improved the OS in patients with tumor size >14mm and age older than 54: 5-year OS rates of 91.9 versus 87.2% (radio vs. nonradio, P <0.001) and cohort with tumor size >14mm and grade worse than well-differentiated, 5-year OS rates of 90.8 versus 82.3% (radio vs. nonradio, P <0.001).The deep learning network performed more stably and accurately in predicting patients survival than the random survival forest and Cox proportional hazard model on the internal test dataset (C-index=0.776 vs 0.641) and in the external validation(C-index=0.769 vs 0.650).Besides, the deep learning model identified several key factors that significantly influence patient survival, including tumor size, examined regional nodes, age at 45-49 years old and positive regional nodes (PRN). Conclusion: Patients with tumor size >14mm and age older than 54 and cohort with tumor size >14mm and grade worse than well-differentiated could benefit from the PMRT. The deep learning network performed more stably and accurately in predicting patients survival than Cox proportional hazard model on the internal test.

Furthermore, we aimed to construct and visualize a prediction model based on LASSO-logistic regression. Methods: Data were collected from 245 patients who underwent their first ERCP with endobiliary metal stent placement for unresectable MBO between June 1, 2013, and August 31, 2021. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for 30-day mortality. We subsequently developed a logistic regression model that incorporated multiple parameters identified by LASSO regression. The model was visualized and the nomogram was plotted. Risk stratification was performed based on nomogram-derived scores. Results: The 30-day mortality rate was 10.7% (23/245 patients). Distant metastasis, total bilirubin, post-ERCP complications, and successful drainage were independent risk factors of 30-day mortality. The variables screened by LASSO regression, including distant metastasis, total bilirubin, post-ERCP complications, and successful drainage, were incorporated into the logistic model. The results were visualized through a nomogram based on the model. To assess the model’s performance, discrimination was evaluated using the area-under-the-curve values obtained from receiver operating characteristic analyses with 10-fold cross-validation in the training group and validated in the testing group. The calibration curve showed the good predictive ability of the model. Decision curve analysis is used to evaluate the clinical application of nomogram. Finally, we performed risk stratification based on the risk calculated using the nomogram. Patients were assigned to the low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups based on their probability scores. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the different nomogram-based groups were significantly different (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We developed a nomogram using the LASSO-logistic regression model to forecast the 30-day mortality rate in patients who had undergone ERCP with endobiliary metal stent placement due to MBO. This nomogram can assist in identifying individuals at high-risk of 30-day mortality following ERCP. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","37649027","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

AKI has been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mortality. We developed machine learning-based prediction models to predict outcomes following AKI stage 3 events in the intensive care unit. We conducted a prospective observational study that used the medical records of ICU patients diagnosed with AKI stage 3. A random forest algorithm was used to develop two models that can predict patients who will progress to CKD after three and six months of experiencing AKI stage 3. To predict mortality, two survival prediction models have been presented using random survival forests and survival XGBoost. We evaluated established CKD prediction models using AUCROC, and AUPR curves and compared them with the baseline logistic regression models. The mortality prediction models were evaluated with an external test set, and the C-indices were compared to baseline COXPH. We included 101 critically ill patients who experienced AKI stage 3. To increase the training set for the mortality prediction task, an unlabeled dataset has been added. The RF (AUPR: 0.895 and 0.848) and XGBoost (c-index: 0.8248) models have a better performance than the baseline models in predicting CKD and mortality, respectively Machine learning-based models can assist clinicians in making clinical decisions regarding critically ill patients with severe AKI who are likely to develop CKD following discharge.

We used machine learning methods to determine factors associated with the decision to extubate the critically ill patient at the end of life, and whether the terminal extubation shortens the dying process. We performed a secondary data analysis of a large, prospective, multicentre, cohort study, death prediction and physiology after removal of therapy (DePPaRT), which collected baseline data as well as ECG, pulse oximeter and arterial waveforms from WLST until 30 min after death. We analysed a priori defined factors associated with the decision to perform terminal extubation in WLST using the random forest method and logistic regression. Cox regression was used to analyse the effect of terminal extubation on time from WLST to death. A total of 616 patients were included into the analysis, out of which 396 (64.3%) were terminally extubated. The study centre, low or no vasopressor support, and good respiratory function were factors significantly associated with the decision to extubate.

In contrast, after adjustment for confounders, time to death of extubated patients was significantly shorter (49 [95% CI: 40; 62] vs. 85 [95% CI: 61; 115] min). The decision to terminally extubate is associated with specific centres and less respiratory and/or vasopressor support.

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 288 acutely decompensated cirrhosis patients with a minimum 1-year follow-up, divided into a training cohort (202 patients, 1010 2D SWE images) and a test cohort (86 patients, 430 2D SWE images). Using transfer learning by Resnet-50 to analyze 2D SWE images, a SWE-based deep learning signature (DLswe) was developed for 1-year mortality prediction. A combined nomogram was established by incorporating deep learning SWE information and laboratory data through a multivariate Cox regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated with respect to predictive discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in the training and test cohorts. Results: The C-index for DLswe was 0.748 (95% CI 0.666–0.829) and 0.744 (95% CI 0.623–0.864) in the training and test cohorts, respectively.

Subjects who died of cardiovascular and respiratory causes were identified whereby the CNN model was used to capture imaging features in the CT scans and the RNN model was used to investigate time series and thus global information. To account for heterogeneity in patients' follow-up times, two different variants of LSTM models were evaluated, each incorporating different strategies to address irregularities in follow-up time. The models were trained on subjects who underwent cardiovascular and respiratory deaths and a control cohort matched to participant age, gender, and smoking history. The combined model can achieve an AUC of 0.76 which outperforms humans at cardiovascular mortality prediction. The corresponding F1 and Matthews Correlation Coefficient are 0.63 and 0.42 respectively. The generalisability of the model is further validated on an ‘external’ cohort. The same models were applied to survival analysis with the Cox Proportional Hazard model. It was demonstrated that incorporating the follow-up history can lead to improvement in survival prediction. The Cox neural network can achieve an IPCW C-index of 0.75 on the internal dataset and 0.69 on an external dataset. Delineating subjects at increased risk of cardiorespiratory mortality can alert clinicians to request further more detailed functional or imaging studies to improve the assessment of cardiorespiratory disease burden. Such strategies may uncover unsuspected and under-recognised pathologies thereby potentially reducing patient morbidity. © 2023 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Patients with multiple complications have high mortality risks and oftentimes require specific intensive care and clinical treatments. The progression of complications is time-varying according to disease development and intrinsic interactions between complications with respect to mortality are uncertain. Classical methods for mortality prediction and survival analysis in critical care, such as risk scoring systems and cause-specific survival models, were not designed for this multi-event survival analysis problem and able to measure the competing risks of death for mutually exclusive events. In addition, multivariate temporal information of complications is not taken into consideration while estimating differentiated mortality risks in the early stage. Methods: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-event survival analysis solution using a tree-based autoregressive survival model of multi-modal electronic health record data. Specifically, we focus on modeling the temporal trajectory of complications and estimating the mortality risk associated with multiple potential complications simultaneously. In dynamic modeling, no assumptions are made for the relationships between time-dependent variables and risk transition over time. Results: Validated with the eICU database, our model achieves a better prediction performance with C-index ranging in 74–80%, compared to state-of-the-art machine learning methods in the literature, for the complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiovascular disease cases. Conclusions: Our model provides the distinguishable mortality risk curves over time for specific complications and the track of risk development that could potentially support the ICU resource reallocation. © 2023","37062155","Article","Final","","Scopus"

A Donor Utilization Score (DUS) was used to compare European and North American donor characteristics for recipients included in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry from 2000 to 2018. DUS was further evaluated as an independent predictor for 1-year freedom from graft failure, after adjusting for recipient risk. Lastly, we assessed donor-recipient risk matching with the outcome of 1-year graft failure. Methods: DUS was applied to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation cohort using meta-modeling. Posttransplant freedom from graft failure was summarized by Kaplan-Meier survival. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to quantify the effects of DUS and Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation score on the 1-year risk of graft failure. We present 4 donor/recipient risk groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: European centers accept significantly higher-risk donor hearts compared to North America. DUS 0.45 versus 0.54, P<0.005). DUS was an independent predictor for graft failure with an inverse linear relationship when adjusted for covariates (P<0.001). The Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation score, a validated tool to assess recipient risk, was also independently associated with 1-year graft failure (P<0.001). In North America, 1-year graft failure was significantly associated with donor-recipient risk matching (log-rank P<0.001). One-year graft failure was highest with pairing of high-risk recipients and donors (13.1% [95% CI, 10.7%-13.9%]) and lowest among low-risk recipients and donors (7.4% [95% CI, 6.8%-8.0%]). Matching of low-risk recipients with high-risk donors was associated with significantly less graft failure (9.0% [95% CI, 8.3%-9.7%]) than high-risk recipients with low-risk donors (11.4% [95% CI, 10.7%-12.2%]) Conclusions: European heart transplantation centers are more likely to accept higher-risk donor hearts than North American centers. Acceptance of borderline-quality donor hearts for lower-risk recipients could improve donor heart utilization without compromising recipient survival. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In this study, we validated the prediction model externally in a different geographic area. Methods and Results: There were 2 prospective multicenter cohorts (1,117 patients in Osaka Prefecture [KICKOFF registry]; 737 patients in Kochi Prefecture [Kochi YOSACOI study]) that had complete datasets for calculation of the KICKOFF score, which was developed by machine learning incorporating physical and social factors. The outcome measure was all-cause death over a 2-year period. Patients were separated into 3 groups: low risk (scores 0-6), moderate risk (scores 7-11), and high risk (scores 12-19). Kaplan-Meier curves clearly showed the score's propensity to predict all-cause death, which rose independently in higher-risk groups (P<0.001) in both cohorts. After 2 years, the cumulative incidence of all-cause death was similar in the KICKOFF registry and Kochi YOSACOI study for the low-risk (4.4% vs. 5.3%, respectively), moderate-risk (25.3% vs. 22.3%, respectively), and high-risk (68.1% vs. 58.5%, respectively) groups. Conclusions: The unique prediction score may be used in different geographic areas in Japan.

In this context, patient stratification based on biomarkers of a dysregulated host response may identify subgroups more likely to respond to targeted immunomodulatory therapeutics. In a prospective cohort of adults hospitalized with suspected sepsis in Uganda, we applied machine learning methods to develop a prediction model for 30-day mortality that integrates physiology-based risk scores with soluble biomarkers reflective of key domains of sepsis immunopathology. After model evaluation and internal validation, whole-blood RNA sequencing data were analyzed to compare biological pathway enrichment and inferred immune cell profiles between patients assigned differential model-based risks of mortality. Of 260 eligible adults (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 26–43 years; 59.2% female, 53.9% living with HIV), 62 (23.8%) died by 30 days after hospital discharge. Among 14 biomarkers, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) demonstrated the greatest importance for mortality prediction in machine learning models. A clinicomolecular model integrating sTNFR1 and Ang-2 with the Universal Vital Assessment (UVA) risk score optimized 30-day mortality prediction across multiple performance metrics. Patients assigned to the high-risk, UVA-based clinicomolecular subgroup exhibited a transcriptional profile defined by proinflammatory innate immune and necroptotic pathway activation, T-cell exhaustion, and expansion of key immune cell subsets including regulatory and gamma-delta T cells. Clinicomolecular stratification of adults with suspected sepsis in Uganda enhanced 30-day mortality prediction and identified a high-risk subgroup with a therapeutically targetable immunological profile.

The aim of this study was to develop a machine-learning model to identify the best potential candidates for upfront surgery (UPS) versus neoadjuvant perioperative chemotherapy followed by surgery (NEOS). Patients at first liver resection for CLM were consecutively enrolled and collected into two groups, regardless of whether they had UPS or NEOS. An inverse –probability weighting (IPW) was performed to weight baseline differences; survival analyses; and risk predictions were estimated. A mortality risk model was built by Random-Forest (RF) to assess the best –potential treatment (BPT) for each patient. The characteristics of BPT-upfront and BPT-neoadjuvant candidates were automatically identified after developing a classification –and –regression tree (CART). A total of 448 patients were enrolled between 2008 and 2020: 95 UPS and 353 NEOS. After IPW, two balanced pseudo-populations were obtained: UPS = 432 and NEOS = 440. Neoadjuvant therapy did not significantly affect the risk of mortality (HR 1.44, 95% CI: 0.95–2.17, p = 0.07). A mortality prediction model was fitted by RF. The BPT was NEOS for 364 patients and UPS for 84. At CART, planning R1vasc surgery was the main factor determining the best candidates for NEOS and UPS, followed by primitive tumor localization, number of metastases, sex, and pre-operative CEA. Based on these results, a decision three was developed. The proposed treatment algorithm allows for better allocation according to the patient’s tailored risk of mortality. © 2023 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Two national cohort, namely, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (8,355 individual older than 18) and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (12,711 individuals older than 45) were used for model development and validation. One hundred and fifty-nine variables were compiled to generate predictions. The Cox regression model and six machine learning (ML) models were used to predict all-cause mortality. Finally, a simple questionnaire-based ML prediction model was developed using the best algorithm and validated. Results: In the internal validation set, all the ML models performed better than the traditional Cox model in predicting 6-year mortality and the random survival forest (RSF) model performed best. The questionnaire-based ML model, which only included 20 variables, achieved a C-index of 0.86 (95%CI: 0.80–0.92).

Survival analysis of the two subgroups produced by hierarchical clustering (HAC) on pairwise trajectory similarity matrix from dynamic time warping (DTW) showed a hazards ratio of 4.7 for 30-day mortality, which was better than the stratification of subgroups from group-based trajectory modeling. The higher mortality subgroup from HAC on DTW displayed higher blood pressure and pulse but lower temperature, in addition to acidosis.

A novel approach, ML-based survival analysis, remains unstudied for predicting mortality after cardiac surgery. We aimed to benchmark performance, as measured by the concordance index (C-index), of tree-based survival models against Cox proportional hazards (CPH) modeling and explore risk factors using the best-performing model. Methods: 144,536 patients with 147,301 surgery events from the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) national database were used to train and validate models. Univariate analysis was performed using Student's T-test for continuous variables, Chi-squared test for categorical variables, and stratified Kaplan-Meier estimation of the survival function. Three ML models were tested, a decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Hyperparameter tuning was performed using a Bayesian search strategy. Performance was assessed using 2-fold cross-validation repeated 5 times. Results: The highest performing model was the GBM with a C-index of 0.803 (0.002), followed by RF with 0.791 (0.003), DT with 0.729 (0.014), and finally CPH with 0.596 (0.042). The 5 most predictive features were age, type of procedure, length of hospital stay, drain output in the first 4 h (ml), and inotrope use greater than 4 h postoperatively. Conclusion: Tree-based learning for survival analysis is a non-parametric and performant alternative to CPH modeling. GBMs offer interpretable modeling of non-linear relationships, promising to expose the most relevant risk factors and uncover new questions to guide future research. 2023 Penny-Dimri, Bergmeir, Reid, Williams-Spence, Perry and Smith.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, under intense working pressure, the medical staff are easily overwhelmed by the large number of clinical signals generated in the ICU, which may lead to treatment delay, sub-optimal care, or even wrong clinical decisions. Individual risk stratification is an essential strategy for managing ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension. Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), can develop superior models to predict the prognosis of these patients. This study aimed to develop a machine learning method to predict the 28-day mortality for ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension. Methods: We enrolled all critically ill patients with HF combined with hypertension in the Medical Information Mart for IntensiveCare Database-IV (MIMIC-IV, v.1.4) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) from 2008 to 2019. Subsequently, MIMIC-IV was divided into training cohort and testing cohort in an 8:2 ratio, and eICU-CRD was designated as the external validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression with internal tenfold cross-validation was used for data dimension reduction and identifying the most valuable predictive features for 28-day mortality. Based on its accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), the best model in the validation cohort was selected. In addition, we utilized the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to highlight the importance of model features, analyze the impact of individual features on model output, and visualize an individual’s Shapley values. Results: A total of 3,458 and 6582 patients with HF combined with hypertension in MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD were included. The patients, including 1,756 males, had a median (Q1, Q3) age of 75 (65, 84) years. After selection, 22 out of a total of 58 clinical parameters were extracted to develop the machine-learning models. Among four constructed models, the Neural Networks (NN) model performed the best predictive performance with an AUC of 0.764 and 0.674 in the test cohort and external validation cohort, respectively. In addition, a simplified model including seven variables was built based on NN, which also had good predictive performance (AUC: 0.741). Feature importance analysis showed that age, mechanical ventilation (MECHVENT), chloride, bun, anion gap, paraplegia, rdw (RDW), hyperlipidemia, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<inf>2</inf>), respiratory rate, cerebrovascular disease, heart rate, white blood cell (WBC), international normalized ratio (INR), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), glucose, AIDS, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Npro. BNP), calcium, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were the top 22 features of the NN model with the greatest impact. Finally, after hyperparameter optimization, SHAP plots were employed to make the NN-based model interpretable with an analytical description of how the constructed model visualizes the prediction of death. Conclusion: We developed a predictive model to predict the 28-day mortality for ICU patients with HF combined with hypertension, which proved superior to the traditional logistic regression analysis. The SHAP method enables machine learning models to be more interpretable, thereby helping clinicians to better understand the reasoning behind the outcome and assess in-hospital outcomes for critically ill patients. © © 2022 Peng, Huang, Liu, Deng, Sun, Tang, Chen, Cao, Wang, Duan, Luo and Peng.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study aims to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models in predicting the mortality of patients admitted to SICUs. The survival of 2,225 adult patients admitted to SICUs was modeled using five salient deep learning-based survival models, namely, Cox-CC, Cox-Time, DeepSurv, DeepHit, and N-MTLR. The data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database. The performance of the models was compared using the time-dependent concordance index (Ctdindex) and integrated Brier score (IBS). From among the five models, DeepSurv achieved the most accurate prediction, while Cox-Time demonstrated the least optimal predictive ability. For DeepSurv, Cox-CC, DeepHit, N-MTLR, and Cox-Time, the mean Ctd -index was 0.773, 0.767, 0.765, 0.732, and 0.659, and the mean IBS was 0.181, 0.192, 0.195, 0.212, and 0.225, respectively. DeepSurv, Cox-CC, and DeepHit yielded comparable performance. Deep learning models are free from the stringent assumptions inherent in standard survival models. Hence, these models are considered flexible alternatives to the standard approaches in scalable, real-world survival problems. © 2022 Malaysian Abstracting and Indexing System.

Early identification of LVH is warranted. In this work, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled model for early detection and risk stratification of LVH using 12-lead ECGs. Methods: By deep learning techniques on the ECG recordings from 28 745 patients (20-60 years old), the AI model was developed to detect verified LVH from transthoracic echocardiography and evaluated on an independent cohort. Two hundred twenty-five patients from Japan were externally validated. Cardiologists' diagnosis of LVH was based on conventional ECG criteria. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were applied to evaluate the model performance. A Cox regression model estimated the independent effects of AI-predicted LVH on cardiovascular or all-cause death. Results: The AUC of the AI model in diagnosing LVH was 0.89 (sensitivity: 90.3%, specificity: 69.3%), which was significantly better than that of the cardiologists' diagnosis (AUC, 0.64). In the second independent cohort, the diagnostic performance of the AI model was consistent (AUC, 0.86; sensitivity: 85.4%, specificity: 67.0%). After a follow-up of 6 years, AI-predicted LVH was independently associated with higher cardiovascular or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.91 [1.04-3.49] and 1.54 [1.20-1.97], respectively). The predictive power of the AI model for mortality was consistently valid among patients of different ages, sexes, and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Last, we also validated the model in the international independent cohort from Japan (AUC, 0.83). Conclusions: The AI model improved the detection of LVH and mortality prediction in the young to middle-aged population and represented an attractive tool for risk stratification. Early identification by the AI model gives every chance for timely treatment to reverse adverse outcomes. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study aims to develop a scalable predictive model in the form of an electronic frailty index (eFI) to predict different adverse outcomes. Methods: This was a population-based cohort study of patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension between January 1st, 2000 and December 31st, 2017, in Hong Kong public hospitals. The primary outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular complications, renal diseases, and diabetes mellitus. The univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were applied to identify the significant risk factors, which were fed into the non-parametric random survival forest (RSF) model to develop an eFI. Results: A total of 2,560 patients with a mean age of 63.4 years old (interquartile range: 38.0–79.0) were included. Over a follow-up, 1,347 died and 1,878, 437, and 684 patients developed cardiovascular complications, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease, respectively. The RSF-model-identified age, average readmission, anti-hypertensive drugs, cumulative length of stay, and total bilirubin were among the most important risk factors for predicting mortality. Pair-wise interactions of factors including diagnosis age, average readmission interval, and cumulative hospital stay were also crucial for the mortality prediction. Patients who developed all-cause mortality had higher values of the eFI compared to those who survived (P < 0.0001). An eFI ≥ 9.5 was associated with increased risks of mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70–2.12; P < 0.0001]. The cumulative hazards were higher among patients who were 65 years old or above with eFI ≥ 9.5. Using the same cut-off point, the eFI predicted a long-term mortality over 10 years (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.53–1.90; P < 0.0001). Compared to the multivariable Cox regression, the precision, recall, area under the curve (AUC), and C-index were significantly higher for RSF in the prediction of outcomes. Conclusion: The RSF models identified the novel risk factors and interactions for the development of complications and mortality. The eFI constructed by RSF accurately predicts the complications and mortality of patients with pulmonary hypertension, especially among the elderly. © © 2022 Zhou, Chou, Wong, Lee, Leung, Liu, Cheung, Wong, Tse and Zhang.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, risk-assessment tools for long-term mortality are largely lacking. We aimed to develop a machine-learning (ML)-based risk-prediction model for long-term all-cause mortality in patients admitted for AHF. Methods and Results: The ML model, based on boosted a Cox regression algorithm (CoxBoost), was trained with 2704 consecutive patients hospitalized for AHF (median age 73 years, 55% male, and median left ventricular ejection fraction 38%). We selected 27 input variables, including 19 clinical features and 8 echocardiographic parameters, for model development. The best-performing model, along with pre-existing risk scores (BIOSTAT-CHF and AHEAD scores), was validated in an independent test cohort of 1608 patients. During the median 32 months (interquartile range 12–54 months) of the follow-up period, 1050 (38.8%) and 690 (42.9%) deaths occurred in the training and test cohorts, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the ML model for all-cause mortality at 3 years was 0.761 (95% CI: 0.754–0.767) in the training cohort and 0.760 (95% CI: 0.752–0.768) in the test cohort. The discrimination performance of the ML model significantly outperformed those of the pre-existing risk scores (AUROC 0.714, 95% CI 0.706–0.722 by BIOSTAT-CHF; and 0.681, 95% CI 0.672–0.689 by AHEAD). Risk stratification based on the ML model identified patients at high mortality risk regardless of heart failure phenotypes. Conclusions: The ML-based mortality-prediction model can predict long-term mortality accurately, leading to optimal risk stratification of patients with AHF. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","35301108","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study aims to assess the prognostic cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) features in PAH using machine learning. Methods and results: Seven hundred and twenty-Three consecutive treatment-naive PAH patients were identified from the ASPIRE registry; 516 were included in the training, and 207 in the validation cohort. A multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA)-based machine learning approach was used to extract mortality and survival features throughout the cardiac cycle. The features were overlaid on the original imaging using thresholding and clustering of high-and low-risk of mortality prediction values. The 1-year mortality rate in the validation cohort was 10%. Univariable Cox regression analysis of the combined short-Axis and four-chamber MPCA-based predictions was statistically significant (hazard ratios: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4, c-index = 0.70, P = 0.002). The MPCA features improved the 1-year mortality prediction of REVEAL from c-index = 0.71 to 0.76 (P ≤ 0.001). Abnormalities in the end-systolic interventricular septum and end-diastolic left ventricle indicated the highest risk of mortality. Conclusion: The MPCA-based machine learning is an explainable time-resolved approach that allows visualization of prognostic cardiac features throughout the cardiac cycle at the population level, making this approach transparent and clinically interpretable. In addition, the added prognostic value over the REVEAL risk score and CMR volumetric measurements allows for a more accurate prediction of 1-year mortality risk in PAH. © 2022 The Author(s).","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Although easy to calculate, it requires additional administrative coding. International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-based models such as the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM-ICD10) circumvent these limitations, but they use linear modeling, which may not adequately capture the intricate relationships of injuries on mortality. Using ICD-10 coding and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the present study used the National Trauma Data Bank to develop mortality prediction models whose performance was compared with logistic regression, ISS, and TMPM-ICD10. METHODS The 2015 to 2017 National Trauma Data Bank was used to identify adults following trauma-related admissions. Of 8,021 ICD-10 codes, injuries were categorized into 1,495 unique variables. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a ML technique that uses iterations of decision trees, was used to develop mortality models. Model discrimination was compared with logistic regression, ISS, and TMPM-ICD10 using receiver operating characteristic curve and probabilistic accuracy with calibration curves. RESULTS Of 1,611,063 patients, 54,870 (3.41%) experienced in-hospital mortality. Compared with those who survived, those who died more frequently suffered from penetrating trauma and had a greater number of injuries. The XGBoost model exhibited superior receiver operating characteristic curve (0.863 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.862-0.864]) compared with logistic regression (0.845 [95% CI, 0.844-0.846]), ISS (0.828 [95% CI, 0.827-0.829]), and TMPM-ICD10 (0.861 [95% CI, 0.860-0.862]) (all p < 0.001). Importantly, the ML model also had significantly improved calibration compared with other methodologies (XGBoost, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.993; logistic regression, R2 = 0.981; ISS, R2 = 0.649; TMPM-ICD10, R2 = 0.830). CONCLUSION Machine learning models using XGBoost demonstrated superior performance and calibration compared with logistic regression, ISS, and TMPM-ICD10. Such approaches in quantifying injury severity may improve its utility in mortality prognostication, quality improvement, and trauma research.

Noncancer death accounts for a high proportion of all patients with bladder cancer, while these patients are often excluded from the survival analysis, which increases the selection bias of the study subjects in the prediction model. Methods. Clinicopathological information of bladder cancer patients was retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and the patients were categorized at random into the training and validation cohorts. The random forest method was used to calculate the importance of clinical variables in the training cohort. Multivariate and univariate analyses were undertaken to assess the risk indicators, and the prediction nomogram based on the competitive risk model was constructed. The model's performance was evaluated utilizing the calibration curve, consistency index (C index), and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results. In total, we enrolled 39285 bladder cancer patients in the study (27500 patients were allotted to the training cohort, whereas 11785 were allotted to the validation cohort). A competitive risk model was constructed to predict bladder cancer-specific mortality. The overall C index of patients in the training cohort was 0.876, and the AUC values were 0.891, 0.871, and 0.853, correspondingly, for 1-, 3-, and 5-year cancer-specific mortality. On the other hand, the overall C index of patients in the validation cohort was 0.877, and the AUC values were 0.894, 0.870, and 0.847 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year correspondingly, suggesting a remarkable predictive performance of the model. Conclusions. The competitive risk model proved to be of great accuracy and reliability and could help clinical decision-makers improve their management and approaches for managing bladder cancer patients. © 2022 Hao Su et al.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The heterogeneity and complexity of this syndrome lead to the absence of golden standards for its diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The early prediction of in-hospital mortality for sepsis patients is not only meaningful to medical decision making, but more importantly, relates to the well-being of patients. Methods: In this paper, a rule discovery and analysis (rule-based) method is used to predict the in-hospital death events of 2021 ICU patients diagnosed with sepsis using the MIMIC-III database. The method mainly includes two phases: rule discovery phase and rule analysis phase. In the rule discovery phase, the RuleFit method is employed to mine multiple hidden rules which are capable to predict individual in-hospital death events. In the rule analysis phase, survival analysis and decomposition analysis are carried out to test and justify the risk prediction ability of these rules. Then by leveraging a subset of these rules, we establish a prediction model that is both more accurate at the in-hospital death prediction task and more interpretable than most comparable methods. Results: In our experiment, RuleFit generates 77 risk prediction rules, and the average area under the curve (AUC) of the prediction model based on 62 of these rules reaches 0.781 (± 0.018) which is comparable to or even better than the AUC of existing methods (i.e., commonly used medical scoring system and benchmark machine learning models). External validation of the prediction power of these 62 rules on another 1468 sepsis patients not included in MIMIC-III in ICU provides further supporting evidence for the superiority of the rule-based method. In addition, we discuss and explain in detail the rules with better risk prediction ability. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), serum potassium, and serum bilirubin are found to be the most important risk factors for predicting patient death. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that, with the rule-based method, we could not only make accurate prediction on in-hospital death events of sepsis patients, but also reveal the complex relationship between sepsis-related risk factors through the rules themselves, so as to improve our understanding of the complexity of sepsis as well as its population. © 2021, The Author(s).","34839820","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Objectives: This study compared proteomics-enabled machine-learning (ML) algorithms with classical and clinical risk prediction methods for all-cause mortality in cohorts of patients with cardiovascular risk factors in the LIFE-Heart Study, followed by validation in the PLIC (Progressione della Lesione Intimale Carotidea) study. Methods: Using the OLINK-Cardiovascular-II panel, 92 proteins were measured in a cohort of 1,998 individuals from the LIFE-Heart Study (derivation) and 772 subjects from the PLIC cohort (external validation). We constructed protein-based mortality prediction models using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a neural network, comparing the prediction performance with classical clinical risk scores (Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation, Framingham), logistic and Cox regression models.

The clinical covariates and the laboratory tests performed on a patient provide robust statistics to guide clinical treatment. Deep learning approaches on a data set of this nature enable patient stratification and provide methods to guide clinical treatment. Objective: Here, we report on the development and prospective validation of a state-of-the-art machine learning model to provide mortality prediction shortly after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mayo Clinic patient population. Methods: We retrospectively constructed one of the largest reported and most geographically diverse laboratory information system and electronic health record of COVID-19 data sets in the published literature, which included 11,807 patients residing in 41 states of the United States of America and treated at medical sites across 5 states in 3 time zones. Traditional machine learning models were evaluated independently as well as in a stacked learner approach by using AutoGluon, and various recurrent neural network architectures were considered. The traditional machine learning models were implemented using the AutoGluon-Tabular framework, whereas the recurrent neural networks utilized the TensorFlow Keras framework. We trained these models to operate solely using routine laboratory measurements and clinical covariates available within 72 hours of a patient’s first positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test result. Results: The GRU-D recurrent neural network achieved peak cross-validation performance with 0.938 (SE 0.004) as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. This model retained strong performance by reducing the follow-up time to 12 hours (0.916 [SE 0.005] AUROC), and the leave-one-out feature importance analysis indicated that the most independently valuable features were age, Charlson comorbidity index, minimum oxygen saturation, fibrinogen level, and serum iron level. In the prospective testing cohort, this model provided an AUROC of 0.901 and a statistically significant difference in survival (P<.001, hazard ratio for those predicted to survive, 95% CI 0.043-0.106). Conclusions: Our deep learning approach using GRU-D provides an alert system to flag mortality for COVID-19–positive patients by using clinical covariates and laboratory values within a 72-hour window after the first positive nucleic acid test result.

Our aim is to (1) construct a risk prediction model for long-term mortality after hip fracture utilizing the RSF method and (2) to evaluate the changing effects over time of individual pre- and post-treatment variables on predicting mortality. Methods: 1330 hip fracture surgical patients were included. Forty-five admission and in-hospital variables were analyzed as potential predictors of all-cause mortality. A random survival forest (RSF) algorithm was applied in predictors identification. Cox regression models were then constructed. Sensitivity analyses and internal validation were performed to assess the performance of each model. C statistics were calculated and model calibrations were further assessed. Results: Our machine-learning RSF algorithm achieved a c statistic of 0.83 for 30-day prediction and 0.75 for 1-year mortality. Additionally, a COX model was also constructed by using the variables selected by RSF, c statistics were shown as 0.75 and 0.72 when applying in 2-year and 4-year mortality prediction. The presence of post-operative complications remained as the strongest risk factor for both short- and long-term mortality. Variables including fracture location, high serum creatinine, age, hypertension, anemia, ASA, hypoproteinemia, abnormal BUN, and RDW became more important as the length of follow-up increased. Conclusion: The RSF machine-learning algorithm represents a novel approach to identify important risk factors and a risk stratification models for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery is built through this approach to identify those at high risk of long-term mortality. © 2020","33386157","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Causes of PI include electrolyte imbalances, gastroenteritis (inflammation or infection of the stomach or intestines), overuse of medications, abdominal surgery, etc. Predicting mortality in PI patients hospitalized to ICU is crucial for assessing the severity of illness and adjudicating the value of treatment strategy and resource planning. We have developed a Statistically Robust Machine Learning based Mortality Prediction framework namely SRML-MortalityPredictor that could potentially help intensivists, surgeons, and other medical professionals to carefully plan treatment strategies for critically ill PI patients. We used MIMIC III v1.4, a publicly available ICU database to extract patients data (with age > 18 years old) admitted to the ICU with paralytic ileus (PI) as their primary illness. At phase 1, the SRML-MortalityPredictor framework uses univariate statistical analysis to filter out those risk factors which are not associated with the label of the data. Subsequently, it uses the risk survival statistical methods such as cox-regression and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses. The cox-regression analysis provides the hazard ratio about the potential PI risk factors that later used in conjunction with the Kaplan–Meier analysis to generate a rank order list (highest to lowest risk factors). At phase 2, we used several machine learning classification approaches such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Gaussian naive bayes (GNB), decision tree (DT) model, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) to find the one with highest predictive power using the rank order features extracted at phase 1. We have evaluated the SRML-MortalityPredictor framework and recorded the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) scores for each model. The SRML-MortalityPredictor framework with support vector machine (using RBF kernel) showed better performance and yielded an accuracy score: 81.30% and AUC score: 81.38% while predicting mortality in PI patients. We demonstrated a feasible framework for the mortality risk prediction in PI patients admitted to the ICU. The proposed framework could potentially be helpful for intensivists in clinical decision making. Further research is necessary to incorporate more risk factors associated with PI patients to ensure the adaptability of SRML-MortalityPredictor at the bedside. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

With growing indications and exponential increase in the number of TAVR procedures, it is important to be able to accurately predict mortality after TAVR. Areas covered: Herein, we review the surgical and TAVR-specific mortality prediction models (MPMs) and their performance in their original derivation and external validation cohorts. We then discuss the role of other important risk assessment tools such as frailty, echocardiographic parameters, and biomarkers in patients, being considered for TAVR. Expert opinion: Conventional surgical MPMs have suboptimal predictive performance and are mis-calibrated when applied to TAVR populations. Although a number of TAVR-specific MPMs have been developed, their utility is also limited by their modest discriminative ability when applied to populations external to their original derivation cohorts. There is an unmet need for robust TAVR MPMs that accurately predict post TAVR mortality. In the interim, heart teams should utilize the currently available TAVR-specific MPMs in conjunction with other prognostic factors, such as frailty, echocardiographic or computed tomography (CT) imaging parameters, and biomarkers for risk assessment of patients, being considered for TAVR. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","33560150","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Our aim was to develop a machine learning-based model to predict mortality using Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive Machine (FLAIM) framework. We hypothesized machine learning could be applied to critically ill patients and would outperform currently used mortality scores. METHODS The current Deep-FLAIM model evaluates the statistically significant risk factors and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to predict mortality in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We analyzed adult patients (=18 years) admitted to the trauma ICU in the publicly available database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III version 1.4. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we applied deep neural network and other traditional machine learning models like Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Model, and k-nearest neighbor models. RESULTS We identified a total of 3,041 trauma patients admitted to the trauma surgery ICU. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses while others were not. With most significant being serum anion gap (hazard ratio [HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.11), sodium (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.61-2.77), and chloride (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.64) abnormalities on laboratories, while clinical variables included the diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.37), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-3.76). And Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria (HR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.26). After we used these clinically significant variables and applied various machine learning models to the data, we found out that our proposed DNN outperformed all the other methods with test set accuracy of 92.25%, sensitivity of 79.13%, and specificity of 94.16%; positive predictive value, 66.42%; negative predictive value, 96.87%; and area under the curve of the receiver-operator curve of 0.91 (1.45-1.29).

Research Question: We hypothesized that applying machine learning to clinical and quantitative CT imaging features would improve mortality prediction in COPD. Study Design and Methods: We selected 30 clinical, spirometric, and imaging features as inputs for a random survival forest. We used top features in a Cox regression to create a machine learning mortality prediction (MLMP) in COPD model and also assessed the performance of other statistical and machine learning models. We trained the models in subjects with moderate to severe COPD from a subset of subjects in Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) and tested prediction performance in the remainder of individuals with moderate to severe COPD in COPDGene and Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE). We compared our model with the BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, exercise capacity (BODE) index; BODE modifications; and the age, dyspnea, and airflow obstruction index. Results: We included 2,632 participants from COPDGene and 1,268 participants from ECLIPSE. The top predictors of mortality were 6-min walk distance, FEV<inf>1</inf> % predicted, and age. The top imaging predictor was pulmonary artery-to-aorta ratio. The MLMP-COPD model resulted in a C index ≥ 0.7 in both COPDGene and ECLIPSE (6.4- and 7.2-year median follow-ups, respectively), significantly better than all tested mortality indexes (P <.05). The MLMP-COPD model had fewer predictors but similar performance to that of other models. The group with the highest BODE scores (7-10) had 64% mortality, whereas the highest mortality group defined by the MLMP-COPD model had 77% mortality (P =.012). Interpretation: An MLMP-COPD model outperformed four existing models for predicting all-cause mortality across two COPD cohorts.

Severity scores based mainly on acute physiology measures collected at ICU admission are used to predict mortality, but are non-specific, and predictions for individual patients can be inaccurate. We investigated whether inclusion of long-term disease history before ICU admission improves mortality predictions. Methods: Registry data for long-term disease histories for more than 230 000 Danish ICU patients were used in a neural network to develop an ICU mortality prediction model. Long-term disease histories and acute physiology measures were aggregated to predict mortality risk for patients for whom both registry and ICU electronic patient record data were available. We compared mortality predictions with admission scores on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and the best available multimorbidity score, the Multimorbidity Index. An external validation set from an additional hospital was acquired after model construction to confirm the validity of our model. During initial model development data were split into a training set (85%) and an independent test set (15%), and a five-fold cross-validation was done during training to avoid overfitting. Neural networks were trained for datasets with disease history of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2·5 years, 5 years, 7·5 years, 10 years, and 23 years before ICU admission. Findings: Mortality predictions with a model based solely on disease history outperformed the Multimorbidity Index (Matthews correlation coefficient 0·265 vs 0·065), and performed similarly to SAPS II and APACHE II (Matthews correlation coefficient with disease history, age, and sex 0·326 vs 0·347 and 0·300 for SAPS II and APACHE II, respectively). Diagnoses up to 10 years before ICU admission affected current mortality prediction. Aggregation of previous disease history and acute physiology measures in a neural network yielded the most precise predictions of in-hospital mortality (Matthews correlation coefficient 0·391 for in-hospital mortality compared with 0·347 with SAPS II and 0·300 with APACHE II). These results for the aggregated model were validated in an external independent dataset of 1528 patients (Matthews correlation coefficient for prediction of in-hospital mortality 0·341). Interpretation: Longitudinal disease-spectrum-wide data available before ICU admission are useful for mortality prediction. Disease history can be used to differentiate mortality risk between patients with similar vital signs with more precision than SAPS II and APACHE II scores. Machine learning models can be deconvoluted to generate novel understandings of how ICU patient features from long-term and short-term events interact with each other. Explainable machine learning models are key in clinical settings, and our results emphasise how to progress towards the transformation of advanced models into actionable, transparent, and trustworthy clinical tools.

As such, there are currently no machine learning studies in the chordoma literature. The purpose of this study was to develop machine learning models for survival prediction and deploy them as open access web applications as a proof of concept for machine learning in rare nervous system lesions. Methods: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database was used to identify adult patients diagnosed with spinal chordoma between 1995 and 2010. Four machine learning models were used to predict 5-year survival for spinal chordoma and assessed by discrimination, calibration, and overall performance. Results: The 5-year overall survival for 265 patients with spinal chordoma was 67.5%. Variables used for prediction were age at diagnosis, tumor size, tumor location, extent of tumor invasion, and extent of surgery. For 5-year survival prediction, the Bayes Point Machine achieved the best performance with a c statistic of 0.80, calibration slope of 1.01, calibration intercept of 0.03, and Brier score of 0.16. This model for 5-year mortality prediction was incorporated into an open access application and can be found online (https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/chordoma/). Conclusions: This analysis of patients with spinal chordoma demonstrated that machine learning models can be developed for survival prediction in rare pathologies and have the potential to serve as the basis for creation of decision support tools in the future. © 2018","30096498","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study compared four popular machine learning algorithms trained on unselected, nation-wide population data from Sweden to solve the binary classification problem of predicting survival versus non-survival 2 years after first myocardial infarction (MI). Methods: This prospective national registry study for prognostic accuracy validation of predictive models used data from 51,943 complete first MI cases as registered during 6 years (2006-2011) in the national quality register SWEDEHEART/RIKS-HIA (90% coverage of all MIs in Sweden) with follow-up in the Cause of Death register (> 99% coverage). Primary outcome was AUROC (C-statistic) performance of each model on the untouched test set (40% of cases) after model development on the training set (60% of cases) with the full (39) predictor set. Model AUROCs were bootstrapped and compared, correcting the P-values for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method. Secondary outcomes were derived when varying sample size (1-100% of total) and predictor sets (39, 10, and 5) for each model. Analyses were repeated on 79,869 completed cases after multivariable imputation of predictors. Results: A Support Vector Machine with a radial basis kernel developed on 39 predictors had the highest complete cases performance on the test set (AUROC = 0.845, PPV = 0.280, NPV = 0.966) outperforming Boosted C5.0 (0.845 vs. 0.841, P = 0.028) but not significantly higher than Logistic Regression or Random Forest. Models converged to the point of algorithm indifference with increased sample size and predictors. Using the top five predictors also produced good classifiers. Imputed analyses had slightly higher performance. Conclusions: Improved mortality prediction at hospital discharge after first MI is important for identifying high-risk individuals eligible for intensified treatment and care. All models performed accurately and similarly and because of the superior national coverage, the best model can potentially be used to better differentiate new patients, allowing for improved targeting of limited resources. Future research should focus on further model development and investigate possibilities for implementation. © 2017 The Author(s).","28679442","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Research has focused on prediction of measurable outcomes, including risk of complications, mortality and length of hospital stay. The length of stay is an important metric both for healthcare providers and patients, influenced by numerous factors. In particular, the length of stay in critical care is of great significance, both to patient experience and the cost of care, and is influenced by factors specific to the highly complex environment of the intensive care unit. The length of stay is often used as a surrogate for other outcomes, where those outcomes cannot be measured; for example as a surrogate for hospital or intensive care unit mortality. The length of stay is also a parameter, which has been used to identify the severity of illnesses and healthcare resource utilisation. This paper examines a range of length of stay and mortality prediction applications in acute medicine and the critical care unit. It also focuses on the methods of analysing length of stay and mortality prediction. Moreover, the paper provides a classification and evaluation for the analytical methods of the length of stay and mortality prediction associated with a grouping of relevant research papers published in the years 1984 to 2016 related to the domain of survival analysis. In addition, the paper highlights some of the gaps and challenges of the domain. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","28539083","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Planning of postoperative ICU admissions is important as ICUs often have no nonoccupied beds available. Problem statement: Estimation of the ICU bed availability for the next coming days is entirely based on clinical judgement by intensivists and therefore too inaccurate. For this reason, predictive models have much potential for improving planning for ICU patient admission. Objective: Our goal is to develop and optimize models for patient survival and ICU length of stay (LOS) based on monitored ICU patient data. Furthermore, these models are compared on their use of sequential organ failure (SOFA) scores as well as underlying raw data as input features. Methodology: Different machine learning techniques are trained, using a 14,480 patient dataset, both on SOFA scores as well as their underlying raw data values from the first five days after admission, in order to predict (i) the patient LOS, and (ii) the patient mortality. Furthermore, to help physicians in assessing the prediction credibility, a probabilistic model is tailored to the output of our best-performing model, assigning a belief to each patient status prediction. A two-by-two grid is built, using the classification outputs of the mortality and prolonged stay predictors to improve the patient LOS regression models. Results: For predicting patient mortality and a prolonged stay, the best performing model is a support vector machine (SVM) with G<inf>A,D</inf>=65.9% (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77) and G<inf>S,L</inf>=73.2% (AUC of 0.82). In terms of LOS regression, the best performing model is support vector regression, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.79 days and a median absolute error of 1.22 days for those patients surviving a nonprolonged stay. Conclusion: Using a classification grid based on the predicted patient mortality and prolonged stay, allows more accurate modeling of the patient LOS. The detailed models allow to support the decisions made by physicians in an ICU setting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","25579436","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, there is still a huge gap in making full use of the time-series data generated from ICUs. Aiming at filling this gap, we propose a novel approach entitled Time Slicing Cox regression (TS-Cox), which extends the classical Cox regression into a classification method on multi-dimensional time-series. Unlike traditional classifiers such as logistic regression and support vector machines, our model not only incorporates the discriminative features derived from the time-series, but also naturally exploits the temporal orders of these features based on a Cox-like function. Empirical evaluation on MIMIC-II database demonstrates the efficacy of the TS-Cox model. Our TS-Cox model outperforms all other baseline models by a good margin in terms of AUC_PR, sensitivity and PPV, which indicates that TS-Cox may be a promising tool for mortality prediction in ICUs.","26958269","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Due to the ethical aspects involved in this medical scenario, physicians tend not to accept a computer-based evaluation unless they understand why and how such a recommendation is given. Therefore, any fuzzy classifier model must be both accurate and interpretable. Methods and materials: The proposed methodology is a three-step process: (1) multi-objective constrained optimization of a patient's data set, using Pareto-based elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to maximize accuracy and minimize the complexity (number of rules) of classifiers, subject to interpretability constraints; this step produces a set of alternative (Pareto) classifiers; (2) linguistic labeling, which assigns a linguistic label to each fuzzy set of the classifiers; this step is essential to the interpretability of the classifiers; (3) decision making, whereby a classifier is chosen, if it is satisfactory, according to the preferences of the decision maker. If no classifier is satisfactory for the decision maker, the process starts again in step (1) with a different input parameter set. Results: The performance of three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, niched pre-selection multi-objective algorithm, elitist Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for diversity reinforcement (ENORA) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), was tested using a patient's data set from an intensive care burn unit and a standard machine learning data set from an standard machine learning repository. The results are compared using the hypervolume multi-objective metric. Besides, the results have been compared with other non-evolutionary techniques and validated with a multi-objective cross-validation technique. Our proposal improves the classification rate obtained by other non-evolutionary techniques (decision trees, artificial neural networks, Naive Bayes, and case-based reasoning) obtaining with ENORA a classification rate of 0.9298, specificity of 0.9385, and sensitivity of 0.9364, with 14.2 interpretable fuzzy rules on average. Conclusions: Our proposal improves the accuracy and interpretability of the classifiers, compared with other non-evolutionary techniques. We also conclude that ENORA outperforms niched pre-selection and NSGA-II algorithms. Moreover, given that our multi-objective evolutionary methodology is non-combinational based on real parameter optimization, the time cost is significantly reduced compared with other evolutionary approaches existing in literature based on combinational optimization. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","24525210","Article","Final","","Scopus"
