Although Pap smear imaging is a widely adopted screening method, large-scale population screening remains resource-intensive, costly, and heavily reliant on specialized medical expertise. The existing landscape of deep learning-based studies faces limitations due to long-tailed distributions and the scarcity of well-annotated, high-quality Pap smear images. In response to these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage, few-shot architecture integrating a federated Siamese network with a Prototypical network. This innovative approach addresses the critical need for more efficient and accurate cervical cancer screening methods, particularly in resource-constrained settings. In the initial stage, we propose a federated optimization technique to pre-train a Siamese encoder utilizing multiple clients, which subsequently acts as a backbone in the subsequent prototypical network for cervical cancer classification. The obtained outcomes reveal a notable accuracy improvement of 2.16% compared to the vanilla prototypical network and a 1.02% enhancement over state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in a 20-shot setting. Our proposed method achieves superior performance while also enabling scalability and enhanced accessibility for cervical cancer screening, thus contributing to more effective early detection and better patient outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

While cytology-based screening is the primary diagnostic approach, conventional manual interpretation suffers from inter-observer variability and limited efficiency. Existing deep learning methods struggle to robustly model morphological variability, disentangle shape and texture features, and quantify prediction uncertainty in cervical cell analysis. We propose HBTF-Net, a novel Hierarchical Bayesian Multi-Task Fusion Network for joint cervical cell segmentation and classification. The framework incorporates three key innovations: a Shape-Texture Feature Decoupling Module (SAFT) employing dual-path encoders within a probabilistic generative model to disentangle latent distributions of shape and texture features; a Classification-Attention Joint Aggregation (CAJA) module integrating multi-scale features via cascaded attention mechanisms including the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Local–Global Attention Transform (LGAT); and a composite loss function combining variational inference, cross-entropy, and hybrid Dice losses for end-to-end optimization. Variational inference and reparameterization techniques ensure efficient learning and uncertainty quantification. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on both a private dataset (HJPD, 1,555 images across 7 categories) and a public benchmark (DSCC, 15,509 images). HBTF-Net demonstrated superior performance across all metrics, achieving 69.13% accuracy on HJPD and 92.26% on DSCC for classification, with 96.96% and 97.14% Dice coefficients for segmentation, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed the synergistic benefits of Bayesian modeling and multi-task learning, while cross-dataset generalization experiments validated the SAFT module's transferability across different staining protocols. HBTF-Net presents an effective solution for interpretable and accurate cervical cytology analysis, offering enhanced uncertainty quantification and feature interpretability crucial for clinical decision-making. The explicit shape-texture decoupling and hierarchical Bayesian framework provide valuable insights for computer-aided cervical cancer screening systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Computer-aided design (CAD) techniques are often used to assist physicians in diagnosing this type of cancer early. This research aimed to accurately diagnose cervical cancer using deep learning techniques applied to cervical MRI scans. Materials and methods: This study used the KAUH-CCMD dataset, which includes 1,974 cervical MRI images collected from 500 women at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) in Jordan. The researchers implemented a deep learning model based on MobileNetV2, enhanced with Transformer Blocks to analyze relationships between image segments. A global attention mechanism (GAMBlock) was used to identify the most significant features. Bayesian optimization was applied to tune hyperparameters such as dropout probability and learning rate to enhance model performance. Results: The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 85.86% in diagnosing cervical cancer, outperforming several pre-trained models, including MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, and Xception.

Its presence signifies disease progression to advanced stages, substantially elevating therapeutic complexity and mortality risks. However, due to the small size of lymph nodes and adhesion between lesions and surrounding tissues causing imaging contrast imbalance, the detection difficulty is greatly increased. Therefore, we propose a precise detection model for pelvic lymph node metastasis based on YOLO11. First, to enhance the expression of lymph node edge features, we design a Multi-scale Feature and Edge information extraction Convolution (MFEConv) module which improves backbone network feature extraction by combining multi-scale depthwise convolutions and differential convolution blocks. Secondly, the Feature Channel Selection aggregation Module (FCSM) is proposed, which uses the adaptive channel weight control mechanism to automatically select key information, so as to retain important discriminant features more accurately when fusing multi-scale features. Finally, to enhance the localization precision of lymph node detection, we construct the NWD-CIoU composite loss function. This function compensates for the positional sensitivity limitations of traditional IoU in small targets by incorporating the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD). Experiments on a dataset of 1,258 pelvic enhanced CT scans demonstrate that our improved model outperforms the baseline YOLO11, achieving a 6.6% increase in mAP@50, 8.5% higher precision, 1.3% improved recall, and 4.4% higher F1-score. This provides more reliable and efficient technical support for precise diagnosis and treatment of pelvic lymph node metastasis in gynaecological tumours. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, we explored fluxomic biomarkers that differentiate responders from non-responders to ICIs in a series of 49 patients with gynecologic cancers, including ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. By applying metabolic enzyme expression as constraints, we utilized an objective-customizable flux balance analysis within a genome-scale metabolic model to predict the metabolic flux differences between responders versus non-responders of ICI treatment. We identified three reactions with consistent differential activity across all ten different optimization objectives: Succinate Dehydrogenase (SUCD1m) in the citric acid cycle, NADH: Guanosine-5-Phosphate Oxidoreductase (r0276) involved in purine catabolism, and Ornithine Transaminase Reversible, Mitochondrial (ORNTArm) in the urea cycle. Additionally, reactions within the folate cycle subsystem, particularly involving MTHFD2, demonstrated significance in distinguishing treatment responses, aligning with previous findings linking MTHFD2 to immune evasion and tumor progression. To further analyze the association between metabolic features and survival outcomes, we implemented machine learning models that integrate multi-omics data. Our model included clinical-pathologic, molecular-genomic features (gene expression, TGF-β score, immune cell abundance from transcriptomic deconvolution), and significant reaction fluxes. Our findings suggest that SUCD1m, MTHFDm and ORNTArm are important metabolic biomarkers that could serve as predictive indicators for ICI response and, if validated in a larger cohort, may guide the development of targeted therapies to enhance treatment efficacy for gynecologic cancer patients.

This study introduces a hybrid framework utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) and ensemble learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) models for cervical cancer classification based on Pap smear images. Two prominent datasets, Mendeley LBC and SIPaKMeD, are employed, encompassing nine distinct categories of cervical cell abnormalities. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained CNN models of DenseNet201, Xception, and InceptionResNetV2 to extract high-level features, further fused through ensemble learning. These features are then processed by the ViT-based encoder model designed for improved interpretability and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves superior accuracy rates of 97.26%, a recall of 97.27%, a precision of 97.27%, and 96.70% for the F1-score on the Mendeley LBC dataset. For the SIPaKMeD dataset, there was an accuracy of 99.18%, a recall of 99.18%, a precision of 99.15%, and a 99.21% F1-score. On the combined dataset, the model outperformed individual pre-trained models with 95.10% accuracy and a 95.01% F1-score. Moreover, the framework incorporates augmentation with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, to provide transparent and interpretable diagnostic outcomes, enhancing its utility in clinical settings.

Accurate classification of cervical cancer cells is crucial due to the inherent complexity and variability in cellular images. Single models often struggle to fully capture the intricate patterns present in complex cell images, necessitating the use of ensemble methods to combine the collective strengths of various models. While previous models have utilized ensemble methods, there is still a significant demand for improved classification performance. This study presents an optimized ensemble method known as Cervi-Net, specifically designed to enhance the classification of cervical cancer cells. Our Cervi-Net model adeptly integrates three top performing well known pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models including DenseNet169, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet201 to make them as base models. Importantly, we utilize grid search to intelligently assign weights to each base model to maximize their contributions for enhancing their collective accuracy. Evaluating the Cervi-Net model on the Mendeley LBC cervical Benchmark dataset (4-classes) reveals a remarkable overall diagnostic accuracy of 97.94%. Furthermore, we employ visualization techniques to highlight infected areas in test images, while ROC plots further assess the performance of proposed model. Additionally, statistical validation through the McNemar test supports the robustness of the model.

It is preventable through early screening, but incidence and mortality rates are significantly higher in LMICs, with 94% of deaths occurring in these regions. Poor implementation of screening programs, in addition to multiple health system barriers, leads to a high burden from cervical cancer in these countries. Projections show increasing cases and deaths due to the disease by 2030. Using machine learning instead of the usual statistical tests will incorporate the complex and non-linear relationship of factors in predicting the outcome variable. Method: The secondary data for ten Sub-Saharan African countries were utilized from the Demographic and Health Survey, DHS, to evaluate cervical cancer screening uptake among women aged 25–49 years. During cleaning missing values and outliers were removed. Class balancing by Synthetic minority oversampling techniques (SMOT) was done and tuning hyperparameters via grid search was used in the models before splitting into training and validation sets containing 89% and 20%, respectively. The following machine learning classification algorithms were used in the study: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Extra Trees. These algorithms were employed to predict cervical cancer screening uptake. The performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Result: In this study, a cervical cancer screening uptake was predicted among 75,360 weighted samples of women from an African country, aged 25–49 with the final data for model formulation of 53,461, where the Extra Trees Classifier obtained an accuracy of 94.13%, a precision of 95.76%, recall of 94.12%, F1-score of 93.80%. Then followed Random Forest: accuracy = 93.87, precision = 99.18%. Health visits, proximity to health care, using contraceptives, residing in urban settings, and exposure to media were its most crucial predictors. The ensemble methods, such as Extra Trees and Random Forest, showed the best generalization, indicating that this work well on complex datasets and can help devise targeted intervention strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the ensemble machine learning models, such as Extra Trees Classifier and Random Forest, are promising in predicting cervical cancer screening uptake among African women with accuracies of 94.13% and 93.87%, respectively. Key predictors include healthcare access, sociocultural factors, media exposure, residence in urban areas, and contraceptive use. The findings emphasize the need for a reduction in care barriers and the use of family planning visits and mass media in promoting screening. These results will be validated in different populations in order to find the clinical integration via decision support systems. © The Author(s) 2025.","40420148","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Early identification and risk assessment are crucial for preventive interventions. Methods: This paper presents the Cervix-AID-Net model for classifying cervical precancer risk using still images captured from a DYSIS colposcope. The study designs and evaluates the proposed Cervix-AID-Net model to classify high-risk and low-risk cervical precancer classes. The model comprises a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and convolutional layers that extract interpretable and representative features from colposcopic images to distinguish high-risk and low-risk cervical precancer. In addition, the proposed Cervix-AID-Net model integrates gradient class activation maps, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, CartoonX, and pixel rate distortion techniques to explain model decisions using output feature maps and input features. Results: The evaluation using holdout and ten-fold cross-validation techniques yielded classification accuracies of 99.33% and 99.81%, respectively. The analysis revealed that CartoonX provides meticulous explanations for the decision of the Cervix-AID-Net model due to its ability to provide the relevant piecewise smooth part of the image. The effect of Gaussian noise and blur on the input shows that the performance remains unchanged up to Gaussian noise of 3% and blur of 10%, while the performance decreases thereafter.

The primary etiology of cervical cancer is the persistent infection of specific high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus. Liquid-based cytology is the established method for early detection of cervical cancer. The evaluation of cellular abnormalities at a microscopic level allows for the identification of malignant or precancerous features in liquid-based cytology pap smears. This technique is characterized by its time-consuming nature and susceptibility to both inter- and intra-observer variability. Hence, the utilization of Artificial Intelligence in computer-assisted diagnosis can reduce the duration needed for diagnosing this ailment, thereby eliminating delayed diagnosis and facilitating the implementation of an efficient treatment. Objective: This research presents a new deep learning-based cervical cancer identification decision support system in liquid-based cytology smear images. Methods: The proposed diagnosis support system incorporates a novel hybrid feature reduction and optimization module, which integrates a sparse Autoencoder with the Binary Harris Hawk metaheuristic optimization algorithm to select the most informative features from a supplemented feature set of the input images. The supplemented feature set is retrieved by three pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks. The module utilizes an improved feature set to conduct a Bayesian-optimized K Nearest Neighbors machine learning classification of cervical cancer in input Pap smears. Results: The introduced approach achieves a classification accuracy of 99.9% and demonstrates an improved ability to detect the stages of cervical cancer, with a sensitivity of 99.8%. In addition, the system has the ability to identify the lack of cervical cancer stages with a specificity rate of 99.9%. Conclusion: The proposed system outpaces recent deep learning-based cervical cancer identification systems. © The Author(s) 2025","40302490","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, extracting these signals solely from sparse, high-dimensional multi-omics data remains a major challenge due to heterogeneity and frequent missingness in patient profiles. To address this challenge, we present SeNMo, a self-normalizing deep neural network trained on five heterogeneous omics layers—gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA abundance, somatic mutations, and protein expression—along with the clinical variables, that learns a unified representation robust to missing modalities. Trained on more than 10,000 patient profiles across 32 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), SeNMo provides a baseline that can be readily fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks. On a held-out TCGA test set, the model achieved a concordance index of 0.758 for OS prediction, while external evaluation yielded 0.73 on the CPTAC lung squamous cell carcinoma cohort and 0.66 on an independent 108-patient Moffitt Cancer Center cohort. Furthermore, on Moffitt’s cohort, baseline SeNMo fine-tuned for TLS ratio prediction aligned with expert annotations (p < 0.05) and sharply separated high- versus low-TLS groups, reflecting distinct survival outcomes. Without altering the backbone, a single linear head classified primary cancer type with 99.8% accuracy across the 33 classes. By unifying diagnostic and prognostic predictions in a modality-robust architecture, SeNMo demonstrated strong performance across multiple clinically relevant tasks, including survival estimation, cancer classification, and TLS ratio prediction, highlighting its translational potential for multi-omics oncology applications. © 2025 by the authors.","40806487","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The timely and accurate identification of different stages of cervical cancer has the capacity to significantly improve both treatment efficacy and patient survival duration. Fluorescence spectroscopy acts as a significantly sensitive technique for identifying the biochemical changes that occur during the advancement of cancer. Fluorescence spectral data was collected from a diverse set of 110 human cervix samples in our study. The spectral data underwent an initial preprocessing step that included data normalization. Subsequently, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was utilized to decompose the signal into several intrinsic mode functions within the spectral domain. Thereafter, various nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, including Isomap, Local Linear Embedding (LLE), and Hessian LLE, were applied to extract more informative features in a lower-dimensional representation. Furthermore, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to categorize the lower dimensional spectral signals into three classes: normal, pre-cancerous, and cancerous. The proposed methodology attained the best evaluation metrics using the Hessian LLE dimensionality reduction technique. A mean classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity of 98.72%, 98.02%, 98.61%, 98.00%, and 99.30%, respectively, were obtained through a 5-fold cross-validation technique. The combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and machine learning holds promise for detecting cancer at earlier stages than current diagnostic methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Early screening can reduce the incidence rate and mortality. Thinprep cytologic test (TCT) is one of the important means of cytological screening, which has high sensitivity and specificity, and has been widely used in the early screening of cervical cancer. The automatic diagnosis of whole slide images (WSIs) by computers can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of doctors’ diagnoses. However, current methods ignore the intrinsic relationships between cervical cells in WSIs and neglect contextual information from the surrounding suspicious areas, and therefore limit their robustness and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method to implement the automatic diagnosis of WSIs, which constructs Graph Attention Networks (GAT) based on local and global fields respectively to capture their contextual information in a hierarchical manner. In the first stage, we extract representative patches from each WSI through suspicious cell detection, and then employ a Local GAT to classify cervical cells by capturing correlations between suspicious cells in image tiles. This classification process provides the confidence and feature vectors for each suspicious cell. In the second stage, we perform WSI classification using a Global GAT model. We construct graphs corresponding to top-K<inf>g</inf> and bottom-K<inf>g</inf> cells for each WSI based on results from Local GAT, and introduce a supervised contrastive learning strategy to enhance the discriminative power of the extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms conventional approaches and effectively showcases the benefits of supervised contrastive learning.

Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for HPV-induced malignancies. This study employed both in silico and in vitro approaches to discover novel JAK2 inhibitors from a library of 76 furochochicine (FCC) derivatives. Twenty-nine compounds were selected via virtual screening, synthesized, and tested for cytotoxicity against HeLa cells. Four FCCs showed potent cytotoxicity with selectivity indices (SI) greater than 3. These cytotoxicity data were used to construct QSAR models with machine learning; eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) yielded the best performance (RMSE = 0.177, R² = 0.831, MAPE = 2.93 %) and was used to predict additional FCC derivatives. FCC90 emerged as a lead compound with strong predictive accuracy (MAPE = 1.43 %) and selectivity (SI = 3.25). JAK2 kinase assays revealed strong inhibition by FCC6, FCC27, and FCC90 (IC₅₀ = 9.10–27.34 nM), with FCC6 and FCC27 surpassing ruxolitinib. Flow cytometry confirmed apoptosis and sub-G1 cell cycle arrest. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the stability of FCC–JAK2 complexes. Furthermore, all active compounds met extended Rule of Five (eRo5) criteria.

This study used data from public databases to identify T cell-related prognostic genes for CESC patients through differential expression analysis and single-cell clustering. A prognostic risk model and nomogram were constructed and validated based on these genes. Pseudotime analysis clarified T cell differentiation processes in CESC. Ultimately, Mendelian randomization (MR) was applied to determine the causal relationship between the prognostic genes and CESC.

Recent technological advancements have the potential to enable quick, cost-effective, and more sensitive screening and treatment measures for CC. Consequently, deep learning (DL)-based approaches have gained importance in classifying CC patients into distinct risk groups. This study proposes an African Vulture Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning assisted Cervical Cancer Detection (AVOADL-CCD) technique. The AVOADL-CCD technique follows Wiener filtering for image pre-processing. Besides, the AVOADL-CCD technique applies Capsule Networks (CapsNet) model for deriving feature vectors. The AVOA can be applied to the CapsNet model for the hyperparameter tuning process. For the automated recognition and classification of CC, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model can be exploited. The experimental outcomes of the AVOADL-CCD method take place on the Herlev dataset. The simulation values show the enhanced detection results of the AVOADL-CCD algorithm over existing techniques with a maximum accuracy of 99.53%. © 2024","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We postulate that this staining technique can also be used for assisting early detection of oral cancer, which is responsible for about 300,000 deaths every year. The rational for such claim includes two key observations: (i) nuclear atypia, i.e., changes in volume, shape, and staining properties of the cell nuclei can be linked to rapid cell proliferation and genetic instability; and (ii) Papanicolaou staining allows one to reliably segment cells’ nuclei and cytoplasms. While Papanicolaou staining is an attractive tool due to its low cost, its interpretation requires a trained pathologist. Our goal is to automate the segmentation and classification of morphological features needed to evaluate the use of Papanicolaou staining for early detection of mouth cancer. Methods: We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic segmentation and classification of cells in Papanicolaou-stained images. Our CNN was trained and evaluated on a new image dataset of cells from oral mucosa consisting of 1,563 Full HD images from 52 patients, annotated by specialists. The effectiveness of our model was evaluated against a group of experts. Its robustness was also demonstrated on five public datasets of cervical images captured with different microscopes and cameras, and having different resolutions, colors, background intensities, and noise levels. Results: Our CNN model achieved expert-level performance in a comparison with a group of three human experts on a set of 400 Papanicolaou-stained images of the oral mucosa from 20 patients. The results of this experiment exhibited high Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values. Despite being trained on images from the oral mucosa, it produced high-quality segmentation and plausible classification for five public datasets of cervical cells. Our Papanicolaou-stained image dataset is the most diverse publicly available image dataset for the oral mucosa in terms of number of patients. Conclusion: Our solution provides the means for exploring the potential of Papanicolaou-staining as a powerful and inexpensive tool for early detection of oral cancer. We are currently using our system to detect suspicious cells and cell clusters in oral mucosa slide images. Our trained model, code, and dataset are available and can help practitioners and stimulate research in early oral cancer detection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","39111154","Article","Final","","Scopus"

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to propose an efficient automated system for the segmentation of cancerous regions in cervical images. METHODS: The proposed techniques encompass preprocessing, feature extraction with an optimized feature set, classification, and segmentation. The original cervical image undergoes smoothing using the Gaussian Filter technique, followed by the extraction of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features from the enhanced cervical images. LBP features capture pixel relationships within a mask window, while GLCM features quantify energy metrics across all pixels in the images. These features serve to distinguish normal cervical images from abnormal ones. The extracted features are optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) as an optimization method, and the optimized sets of features are classified using the Co-Active Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) classification method. Subsequently, a morphological segmentation technique is employed to categorize irregular cervical images, identifying and segmenting malignant regions within them. RESULTS: The proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 99.09%, specificity of 99.39%, and accuracy of 99.36%.

Early diagnosis can significantly improve the 5-year survival rate of patients. With the development of artificial intelligence, computer-assisted diagnosis plays an increasingly important role in improving the accuracy and objectivity of diagnosis and reducing the workload of doctors. However, the absence of publicly available image datasets restricts the application of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques. Methods: In this paper, a publicly available Endometrial Cancer PET/CT Image Dataset for Evaluation of Semantic Segmentation and Detection of Hypermetabolic Regions (ECPC-IDS) are published. Specifically, the segmentation section includes PET and CT images, with 7159 images in multiple formats totally. In order to prove the effectiveness of segmentation on ECPC-IDS, six deep learning semantic segmentation methods are selected to test the image segmentation task. The object detection section also includes PET and CT images, with 3579 images and XML files with annotation information totally. Eight deep learning methods are selected for experiments on the detection task. Results: This study is conduct using deep learning-based semantic segmentation and object detection methods to demonstrate the distinguishability on ECPC-IDS. From a separate perspective, the minimum and maximum values of Dice on PET images are 0.546 and 0.743, respectively. The minimum and maximum values of Dice on CT images are 0.012 and 0.510, respectively. The target detection section's maximum mAP values on PET and CT images are 0.993 and 0.986, respectively. Conclusion: As far as we know, this is the first publicly available dataset of endometrial cancer with a large number of multi-modality images.

However, the lack of trained cytopathologists hinders its widespread implementation in low-resource settings. Deep learning-assisted telecytology diagnosis emerges as an appealing alternative, but it requires the collection of large annotated training datasets, which is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we demonstrate that the abundance of unlabeled images that can be extracted from Pap smear test whole slide images presents a fertile ground for self-supervised learning methods, yielding performance improvements compared to off-the-shelf pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. In particular, we propose Cervical Cell Copy-Pasting (C3P) as an effective augmentation method, which enables knowledge transfer from public and labeled single-cell datasets to unlabeled tiles. Not only does C3P outperforms naive transfer from single-cell images, but we also demonstrate its advantageous integration into multiple instance learning methods. Importantly, all our experiments are conducted on our introduced in-house dataset comprising liquid-based cytology Pap smear images obtained using low-cost technologies.

Additionally, we seek to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms through which USP26 modulates Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and assess the subsequent effects of this regulation on both the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells. Methods: All the deubiquitinase (DUB) sequences were classified into USPs and non-USPs. Feature vectors, including 188D, n-gram, and 400D dimensions, were extracted from these sequences and subjected to binary classification via the Weka software. Next, thirty human USPs were also analyzed to identify conserved motifs and ascertained evolutionary relationships. Experimentally, more than 90 unique DUB-encoding plasmids were transfected into HeLa cell lines to assess alterations in KLF6 protein levels and to isolate a specific DUB involved in KLF6 regulation. Subsequent experiments utilized both wild-type (WT) USP26 overexpression and shRNA-mediated USP26 knockdown to examine changes in KLF6 protein levels. The half-life experiment was performed to assess the influence of USP26 on KLF6 protein stability. Immunoprecipitation was applied to confirm the USP26-KLF6 interaction, and ubiquitination assays to explore the role of USP26 in KLF6 deubiquitination. Additional cellular assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of USP26 on HeLa cell proliferation and migration. Results: 1. Among the extracted feature vectors of 188D, 400D, and n-gram, all 12 classifiers demonstrated excellent performance. The RandomForest classifier demonstrated superior performance in this assessment. Phylogenetic analysis of 30 human USPs revealed the presence of nine unique motifs, comprising zinc finger and ubiquitin-specific protease domains. 2. Through a systematic screening of the deubiquitinase library, USP26 was identified as the sole DUB associated with KLF6. 3. USP26 positively regulated the protein level of KLF6, as evidenced by the decrease in KLF6 protein expression upon shUSP26 knockdown in both 293T and Hela cell lines. Additionally, half-life experiments demonstrated that USP26 prolonged the stability of KLF6. 4. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a strong interaction between USP26 and KLF6. Notably, the functional interaction domain was mapped to amino acids 285–913 of USP26, as opposed to the 1–295 region. 5. WT USP26 was found to attenuate the ubiquitination levels of KLF6. However, the mutant USP26 abrogated its deubiquitination activity. 6. Functional biological assays demonstrated that overexpression of USP26 inhibited both proliferation and migration of HeLa cells. Conversely, knockdown of USP26 was shown to promote these oncogenic properties. Conclusions: 1. At the protein sequence level, members of the USP family can be effectively differentiated from non-USP proteins. Furthermore, specific functional motifs have been identified within the sequences of human USPs. 2. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP26 has been shown to target KLF6 for deubiquitination, thereby modulating its stability. Importantly, USP26 plays a pivotal role in the modulation of proliferation and migration in cervical cancer cells. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","38064851","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, we utilized various bioinformatics methods to analyze the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data, gene chip and the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA seq) data. And a necroptosis-related genes signature for prognostic assessment of patients with cervical cancer was constructed successfully. Survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm and random forest analysis were performed to validate this signature. Patients in TCGA-CESC cohort were grouped into “high-necroptosis score (H-NCPS)"" vs “low-necroptosis score (L-NCPS)"" subgroups based on the median of necroptosis score of each patient. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment manifested “H-NCPS” patients associated with lower degree of immune infiltration. Through the utilization of survival analysis, cell communication, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), PGK1 was determined to be the pivotal gene within the 9-gene signature associated with necroptosis. The high expression of PGK1 in cervical cancer cells was confirmed through the utilization of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and the human protein atlas (HPA). In the interim, PGK1 prompted the transition of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages and influenced the occurrence and development of necroptosis. In conclusion, the 9-gene signature developed from necroptosis-related genes has shown significant predictive capabilities for the prognosis of cervical cancer, offered valuable guidance for individualized and targeted treatment approaches for patients. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","38029530","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This task, however, is rather challenging, mainly due to the difficulty of collecting a training dataset representative sufficiently of the unseen test data, as there are wide variations of cells’ appearance and shape at different cancerous statuses. This difficulty makes the classifier, though trained properly, often classify wrongly for cells that are underrepresented by the training dataset, eventually leading to a wrong screening result. To address it, we propose a new learning algorithm, called worse-case boosting, for classifiers effectively learning from under-representative datasets in cervical cell classification. The key idea is to learn more from worse-case data for which the classifier has a larger gradient norm compared to other training data, so these data are more likely to correspond to underrepresented data, by dynamically assigning them more training iterations and larger loss weights for boosting the generalizability of the classifier on underrepresented data. We achieve this idea by sampling worse-case data per the gradient norm information and then enhancing their loss values to update the classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new learning algorithm on two publicly available cervical cell classification datasets (the two largest ones to the best of our knowledge), and positive results (4% accuracy improvement) yield in the extensive experiments.

Considering the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), we obtained values of 0.946 for the general model, 0.945 for the model with the five main cancers, 0.899 for bronchial and lung cancer, 0.947 for breast cancer, 0.866 for stomach cancer, 0.872 for colon cancer, 0.923 for rectum cancer, 0.955 for prostate cancer, and 0.917 for uterine cervix cancer. Our results indicate the potential of building models for predicting mortality risk in cancer patients in developing regions using only routinely-collected data. © 2023","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Therefore, repetitive screening for cervical cancer is of utmost importance. Computer-assisted diagnosis is key for scaling up cervical cancer screening. Current recognition algorithms, however, perform poorly on the whole-slide image (WSI) analysis, fail to generalize for different staining methods and on uneven distribution for subtype imaging, and provide sub-optimal clinical-level interpretations. Herein, we developed CervixFormer—an end-to-end, multi-scale swin transformer-based adversarial ensemble learning framework to assess pre-cancerous and cancer-specific cervical malignant lesions on WSIs. Methods: The proposed framework consists of (1) a self-attention generative adversarial network (SAGAN) for generating synthetic images during patch-level training to address the class imbalanced problems; (2) a multi-scale transformer-based ensemble learning method for cell identification at various stages, including atypical squamous cells (ASC) and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), which have not been demonstrated in previous studies; and (3) a fusion model for concatenating ensemble-based results and producing final outcomes. Results: In the evaluation, the proposed method is first evaluated on a private dataset of 717 annotated samples from six classes, obtaining a high recall and precision of 0.940 and 0.934, respectively, in roughly 1.2 minutes. To further examine the generalizability of CervixFormer, we evaluated it on four independent, publicly available datasets, namely, the CRIC cervix, Mendeley LBC, SIPaKMeD Pap Smear, and Cervix93 Extended Depth of Field image datasets. CervixFormer obtained a fairly better performance on two-, three-, four-, and six-class classification of smear- and cell-level datasets. For clinical interpretation, we used GradCAM to visualize a coarse localization map, highlighting important regions in the WSI. Notably, CervixFormer extracts feature mostly from the cell nucleus and partially from the cytoplasm. Conclusions: In comparison with the existing state-of-the-art benchmark methods, the CervixFormer outperforms them in terms of recall, accuracy, and computing time. © 2023","37451230","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Early diagnosis and treatment can minimize the complications of this cancer. Recently, researchers have designed and implemented many deep learning-based automated cervical cancer diagnosis models. However, the majority of these models suffer from over-fitting, parameter tuning, and gradient vanishing problems. To overcome these problems, in this paper a metaheuristics-based lightweight deep learning network (MLNet) is proposed. Initially, the hyper-parameters tuning problem of convolutional neural network (CNN) is defined as a multi-objective problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimally define the CNN architecture. Thereafter, Dynamically hybrid niching differential evolution (DHDE) is utilized to optimize the hyper-parameters of CNN layers. Each particle of PSO and solution of DHDE together represent the possible CNN configuration. F-score is used as a fitness function. The proposed MLNet is trained and validated on three benchmark cervical cancer datasets. On the Herlev dataset, MLNet outperforms the existing models in terms of accuracy, f-measure, sensitivity, specificity, and precision by 1.6254%, 1.5178%, 1.5780%, 1.7145%, and 1.4890%, respectively. Also, on the SIPaKMeD dataset, MLNet achieves better performance than the existing models in terms of accuracy, f-measure, sensitivity, specificity, and precision by 2.1250%, 2.2455%, 1.9074%, 1.9258%, and 1.8975%, respectively. Finally, on the Mendeley LBC dataset, MLNet achieves better performance than the competitive models in terms of accuracy, f-measure, sensitivity, specificity, and precision by 1.4680%, 1.5845%, 1.3582%, 1.3926%, and 1.4125%, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","36399582","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Early detection and adequate treatment according to staging improve the patient's life expectancy. Outcome prediction models might aid treatment decisions, but a systematic review on prediction models for cervical cancer patients is not available. Design: We performed a systematic review for prediction models in cervical cancer following PRISMA guidelines. Key features that were used for model training and validation, the endpoints were extracted from the article and data were analyzed. Selected articles were grouped based on prediction endpoints i.e. Group1: Overall survival, Group2: progression-free survival; Group3: recurrence or distant metastasis; Group4: treatment response; Group5: toxicity or quality of life. We developed a scoring system to evaluate the manuscript. As per our criteria, studies were divided into four groups based on scores obtained in our scoring system, the Most significant study (Score > 60 %); Significant study (60 % > Score > 50 %); Moderately Significant study (50 % > Score > 40 %); least significant study (score < 40 %). A meta-analysis was performed for all the groups separately. Results: The first line of search selected 1358 articles and finally 39 articles were selected as eligible for inclusion in the review. As per our assessment criteria, 16, 13 and 10 studies were found to be the most significant, significant and moderately significant respectively. The intra-group pooled correlation coefficient for Group1, Group2, Group3, Group4, and Group5 were 0.76 [0.72, 0.79], 0.80 [0.73, 0.86], 0.87 [0.83, 0.90], 0.85 [0.77, 0.90], 0.88 [0.85, 0.90] respectively. All the models were found to be good (prediction accuracy [c-index/AUC/R2] >0.7) in endpoint prediction. Conclusions: Prediction models of cervical cancer toxicity, local or distant recurrence and survival prediction show promising results with reasonable prediction accuracy [c-index/AUC/R2 > 0.7].

The objective of this systematic review was to assess and critically appraise the methodologies and approaches used in predicting the prognosis of gynecological cancers using CAPs. Methods: Electronic databases were used to systematically search for studies utilizing machine learning methods in gynecological cancers. Study risk of bias (ROB) and applicability were assessed using the PROBAST tool. 139 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 71 predicted outcomes for ovarian cancer patients, 41 predicted outcomes for cervical cancer patients, 28 predicted outcomes for uterine cancer patients, and 2 predicted outcomes for gynecological malignancies broadly. Results: Random forest (22.30 %) and support vector machine (21.58 %) classifiers were used most commonly. Use of clinicopathological, genomic and radiomic data as predictors was observed in 48.20 %, 51.08 % and 17.27 % of studies, respectively, with some studies using multiple modalities. 21.58 % of studies were externally validated. Twenty-three individual studies compared ML and non-ML methods. Study quality was highly variable and methodologies, statistical reporting and outcome measures were inconsistent, preventing generalized commentary or meta-analysis of performance outcomes. Conclusion: There is significant variability in model development when prognosticating gynecological malignancies with respect to variable selection, machine learning (ML) methods and endpoint selection. This heterogeneity prevents meta-analysis and conclusions regarding the superiority of ML methods. Furthermore, PROBAST-mediated ROB and applicability analysis demonstrates concern for the translatability of existing models. This review identifies ways that this can be improved upon in future works to develop robust, clinically translatable models within this promising field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","37100507","Review","Final","","Scopus"

The diagnosis and classification of cancer are extremely important, as it influences the optimal treatment and length of survival. The objective was to develop and validate a diagnosis system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) that identifies cervical malignancies and provides diagnostic interpretability. A total of 8496 labeled histology images were extracted from 229 cervical specimens (cervical squamous cell carcinoma, SCC, n = 37; cervical adenocarcinoma, AC, n = 8; nonmalignant cervical tissues, n = 184). AlexNet, VGG-19, Xception, and ResNet-50 with five-fold cross-validation were constructed to distinguish cervical cancer images from nonmalignant images. The performance of CNNs was quantified in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Six pathologists were recruited to make a comparison with the performance of CNNs. Guided Backpropagation and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) were deployed to highlight the area of high malignant probability. The Xception model had excellent performance in identifying cervical SCC and AC in test sets. For cervical SCC, AUC was 0.98 (internal validation) and 0.974 (external validation). For cervical AC, AUC was 0.966 (internal validation) and 0.958 (external validation). The performance of CNNs falls between experienced and inexperienced pathologists. Grad-CAM and Guided Gard-CAM ensured diagnoses interpretability by highlighting morphological features of malignant changes. CNN is efficient for histological image classification tasks of distinguishing cervical malignancies from benign tissues and could highlight the specific areas of concern. All these findings suggest that CNNs could serve as a diagnostic tool to aid pathologic diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","36474087","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Pap-smear tests are preferred by doctors as the primary tool in the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Physicians can be facilitated in the detection of five different categories of cervical cancer and similar cellular disease cases with the Pap-smear image retrieval technology. In this study, an algorithm for retrieval of cervical cancer images using hash coding with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been implemented. A sensitive deep hashing method combining interpretable mask generation and rotation invariance is proposed for cervical cancer detection. The distinctive features of cervical cancer cells with complex morphological features are focused on with the proposed hybrid dilated convolution spatial attention module and insignificant features are eliminated. Moreover, the loss function of Cauchy rotation invariance in terms of cervical cancer cell target is presented. In this way, the differences in the input samples are revealed, allowing the CNN to learn from different angles and achieve certain rotation invariance. The versatility and performance of the proposed method, as well as the efficiency of the loss function, have been tested on the SIPaKMeD and Mendeley LBC datasets consisting of cervical cancer images. In the experimental results obtained, it is shown that the proposed spatial attention module and rotational invariance deep hashing network generate high performance in cervical cancer image retrieval problems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","36738706","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It is believed that, automated systems based on artificial intelligence would allow the early diagnostic which increases significantly the chances of proper treatment and survival. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level performance in object classification tasks, the regular growing of the amount of medical data and the continuous increase of the number of classes make them difficult to learn new tasks without being re-trained from scratch. Nevertheless, fine tuning and transfer learning in deep models are techniques that lead to the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, an Incremental Deep Tree (IDT) framework for biological image classification is proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting of CNNs allowing them to learn new classes while maintaining acceptable accuracies on the previously learnt ones. To evaluate the performance of our approach, the IDT framework is compared against with three popular incremental methods, namely iCaRL, LwF and SupportNet. The experimental results on MNIST dataset achieved 87 % of accuracy and the obtained values on the BreakHis, the LBC and the SIPaKMeD datasets are promising with 92 %, 98 % and 93 % respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","36462909","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Cytology is the current dominant clinical screening approach, and though it has been used for decades, it has unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity. In this work, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was used for the imaging of exfoliated cervical cells in which an endogenous coenzyme involved in metabolism, namely, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [NAD(P)H], was detected to evaluate the metabolic status of cells. FLIM images from 71 participants were analyzed by the unsupervised machine learning method to build a prediction model for cervical cancer risk. The FLIM method combined with unsupervised machine learning (FLIM-ML) had a sensitivity and specificity of 90.9% and 100%, respectively, significantly higher than those of the cytology approach. One cancer recurrence case was predicted as high-risk several months earlier using this method as compared to using current clinical methods, implying that FLIM-ML may be very helpful for follow-up cancer care. This study illustrates the clinical applicability of FLIM-ML as a detection method for cervical cancer screening and a convenient tool for follow-up cancer care. © 2022 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Increased TLS activity, the particularly elevated expression of TLS polymerases, has been linked to resistance to cancer chemotherapeutics and significantly altered patient outcomes. Building upon current knowledge, we found that the expression of one of these TLS polymerases (POLI) is associated with significant differences in cervical and pancreatic cancer survival. These data led us to hypothesize that POLI expression is associated with cancer survival more broadly. However, when cancers were grouped cancer type, POLI expression did not have a significant prognostic value. We presented a binary cancer random forest classifier using 396 genes that influence the prognostic characteristics of POLI in cervical and pancreatic cancer selected via graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The classifier was then used to cluster patients with bladder, breast, colorectal, head and neck, liver, lung, ovary, melanoma, stomach, and uterus cancer when high POLI expression was associated with worsened survival (Group I) or with improved survival (Group II). This approach allowed us to identify cancers where POLI expression is a significant prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.028 in Group I and p = 0.0059 in Group II). Multiple independent validation approaches, including the gene ontology enrichment analysis and visualization tool and network visualization support the classification scheme. The functions of the selected genes involving mitochondrial translational elongation, Wnt signaling pathway, and tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway support their association with TLS and replication stress. Our multidisciplinary approach provides a novel way of identifying tumors where increased TLS polymerase expression is associated with significant differences in cancer survival. © 2022 by the authors.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Like any other disease, cervical cancer's early detection and treatment with the best possible medical advice are the paramount steps that should be taken to ensure the minimization of after-effects of contracting this disease. PaP smear images are one the most effective ways to detect the presence of such type of cancer. This article proposes a fuzzy distance-based ensemble approach composed of deep learning models for cervical cancer detection in PaP smear images. Methods: We employ three transfer learning models for this task: Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and Inception ResNet V2, with additional layers to learn data-specific features. To aggregate the outcomes of these models, we propose a novel ensemble method based on the minimization of error values between the observed and the ground-truth. For samples with multiple predictions, we first take three distance measures, i.e., Euclidean, Manhattan (City-Block), and Cosine, for each class from their corresponding best possible solution. We then defuzzify these distance measures using the product rule to calculate the final predictions. Results: In the current experiments, we have achieved 95.30%, 93.92%, and 96.44% respectively when Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and Inception ResNet V2 run individually. After applying the proposed ensemble technique, the performance reaches 96.96% which is higher than the individual models. Conclusion: Experimental outcomes on three publicly available datasets ensure that the proposed model presents competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach provides an end-to-end classification technique to detect cervical cancer from PaP smear images. This may help the medical professionals for better treatment of the cervical cancer. Thus increasing the overall efficiency in the whole testing process.

However, it can be treated successfully at an early stage. This study aims to propose an image processing algorithm based on acetowhite, which is an important criterion for diagnosing cervical cancer, to increase the accuracy of the deep learning classification model. Then, we mainly compared the performance of the model, the original image without image processing, a mask image made with acetowhite as the region of interest, and an image using the proposed algorithm. In conclusion, the deep learning classification model based on images with the proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 81.31%, which is approximately 9% higher than the model with original images and approximately 4% higher than the model with acetowhite mask images. Our study suggests that the proposed algorithm based on acetowhite could have a better performance than other image processing algorithms for classifying stages of cervical images. © 2022 by the authors.

Application of ML is often hindered by incompleteness of the data which is particularly evident when approaching disease screening data due to varied testing regimens across medical institutions. Here we explored the utility of multiple ML algorithms to predict cancer risk when trained using a large but incomplete real-world dataset of tumor marker (TM) values. Methods: TM screening data were collected from a large asymptomatic cohort (n = 163,174) at two independent medical centers. The cohort included 785 individuals who were subsequently diagnosed with cancer. Data included levels of up to eight TMs, but for most subjects, only a subset of the biomarkers were tested. In some instances, TM values were available at multiple time points, but intervals between tests varied widely. The data were used to train and test various machine learning models to evaluate their robustness for predicting cancer risk. Multiple methods for data imputation were explored and models were developed for both single time-point as well as time-series data. Results: The ML algorithm, long short-term memory (LSTM), demonstrated superiority over other models for dealing with irregular medical data. A cancer risk prediction tool was trained and validated for a single time-point test of a TM panel including up to four biomarkers (AUROC = 0.831, 95% CI: 0.827–0.835) which outperformed a single threshold method using the same biomarkers. A second model relying on time series data of up to four time-points for 5 TMs had an AUROC of 0.931. Conclusions: A cancer risk prediction tool was developed by training a LSTM model using a large but incomplete real-world dataset of TM values. The LSTM model was best able to handle irregular data compared to other ML models. The use of time-series TM data can further improve the predictive performance of LSTM models even when the intervals between tests vary widely. These risk prediction tools are useful to direct subjects to further screening sooner, resulting in earlier detection of occult tumors. © 2022 The Authors","35299045","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Diagnosis of cervical lesions is done using pap smear test or visual inspection using acetic acid (staining). Digital colposcopy, an inexpensive methodology, provides painless and efficient screening results. Therefore, automating cervical cancer screening using colposcopy images will be highly useful in saving many lives. Nowadays, many automation techniques using computer vision and machine learning in cervical screening gained attention, paving the way for diagnosing cervical cancer. However, most of the methods rely entirely on the annotation of cervical spotting and segmentation. This paper aims to introduce the Faster Small-Object Detection Neural Networks (FSOD-GAN) to address the cervical screening and diagnosis of cervical cancer and the type of cancer using digital colposcopy images. The proposed approach automatically detects the cervical spot using Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (FR-CNN) and performs the hierarchical multiclass classification of three types of cervical cancer lesions. Experimentation was done with colposcopy data collected from available open sources consisting of 1,993 patients with three cervical categories, and the proposed approach shows 99% accuracy in diagnosing the stages of cervical cancer. © 2013 IEEE.","34214045","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Tumor region segmentation plays a pivotal role in both the clinical analysis and treatment planning of cervical cancer. Due to the heterogeneity and low contrast of biomedical images, current state-of-the-art tumor segmentation approaches are facing the challenge of the insensitive detection of small lesion regions. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an augmented multiscale network (AugMS-Net) based on 3D U-Net to automatically segment cervical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumes. Since a multiscale strategy is considered one of the most promising algorithms to tackle small object recognition, we introduce a novel 3D module to explore more granular multiscale representations. Besides, we employ a deep multiscale supervision strategy to doubly supervise the side outputs hierarchically. To demonstrate the generalization of our model, we evaluated AugMS-Net on both a cervical dataset from MRI volumes and a liver dataset from Computerized Tomography (CT) volumes. Our proposed AugMS-Net shows superior performance over baseline models, yielding high accuracy while reducing the number of model parameters by nearly 20%.

Early screening for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or above (HSIL+), including early stages of cervical cancer, is the key to improve the survival rate. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been developed via deep learning methods to automatically detect biopsy regions based on colposcopy images (i.e., cervicograms). However, most existing AI tools only learn from the single-channel acetic acid cervicograms, which is known to have the caveat of inflated false positive detections. Since both acetic acid and Lugol's iodine cervicograms are considered by physicians in clinic, it is important for AI tools to fuse both types of cervicograms to achieve desired accuracy. Thus, we develop a novel deep learning based AI tool, referred to as HLDnet (HSIL+ Detection Network), to fuse the information of both types of cervicograms to ensure satisfactory accuracy of detecting HSIL+ regions. The HLDnet framework fuses the detection results of the dual-channel target detection algorithm by adopting late fusion. Specifically, HLDnet uses the Intersection over Union (IoU) decision algorithm to evaluate the proportion of common lesion region detected on both types of colposcopy images, which will reduce false positive rate and improve detection accuracy of HSIL+ regions. By applying HLDnet to real clinical cervicograms of 400 training and validation patients with HSIL+ and additional 200 test patients (100 HSIL+ and 100 LSIL-), we obtained accuracy 0.86 (sensitivity 0.82 and specificity 0.90) with the test data, outperforming the respective accuracy 0.61 or 0.53 by single-channel detection using only acetic acid cervicograms or Lugol's iodine. Overall, our AI tool HLDnet is expected to improve the accuracy of automatic pre-cervix-cancer screening, so that it can help increase the availability of pre-cervix-cancer screening to worldwide people, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This study aimed to find efficient machine-learning-based classifying models to detect early stage CC using clinical data. We obtained a Kaggle data repository CC dataset which contained four classes of attributes including biopsy, cytology, Hinselmann, and Schiller. This dataset was split into four categories based on these class attributes. Three feature transformation methods, including log, sine function, and Z-score were applied to these datasets. Several supervised machine learning algorithms were assessed for their performance in classification. A Random Tree (RT) algorithm provided the best classification accuracy for the biopsy (98.33%) and cytology (98.65%) data, whereas Random Forest (RF) and Instance-Based K-nearest neighbor (IBk) provided the best performance for Hinselmann (99.16%), and Schiller (98.58%) respectively. Among the feature transformation methods, logarithmic gave the best performance for biopsy datasets whereas sine function was superior for cytology. Both logarithmic and sine functions performed the best for the Hinselmann dataset, while Z-score was best for the Schiller dataset. Various Feature Selection Techniques (FST) methods were applied to the transformed datasets to identify and prioritize important risk factors.

Early detection of and treatment at the precancerous stage can help reduce mortality. High-grade cervical abnormalities and precancer are confirmed using microscopic analysis of cervical histopathology. However, manual analysis of cervical biopsy slides is time-consuming, needs expert pathologists, and suffers from reader variability errors. Prior work in the literature has suggested using automated image analysis algorithms for analyzing cervical histopathology images captured with the whole slide digital scanners (e.g., Aperio, Hamamatsu, etc.). However, whole-slide digital tissue scanners with good optical magnification and acceptable imaging quality are cost-prohibitive and difficult to acquire in low and middle-resource regions. Hence, the development of low-cost imaging systems and automated image analysis algorithms are of critical importance. Motivated by this, we conduct an experimental study to assess the feasibility of developing a low-cost diagnostic system with the H&E stained cervical tissue image analysis algorithm. In our imaging system, the image acquisition is performed by a smartphone affixing it on the top of a commonly available light microscope which magnifies the cervical tissues. The images are not captured in a constant optical magnification, and, unlike whole-slide scanners, our imaging system is unable to record the magnification. The images are mega-pixel images and are labeled based on the presence of abnormal cells. In our dataset, there are total 1331 (train: 846, validation: 116 test: 369) images. We formulate the classification task as a deep multiple instance learning problem and quantitatively evaluate the classification performance of four different types of multiple instance learning algorithms trained with five different architectures designed with varying instance sizes. Finally, we designed a sparse attention-based multiple instance learning framework that can produce a maximum of 84.55% classification accuracy on the test set. © 2021","34601391","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Owing to the heterogeneity, a quantitative synthesis was not appropriate in this review. Conclusions: In gynecologic oncology, more studies have been conducted on cervical cancer than on ovarian and endometrial cancers. Prognoses were mainly used in the study of cervical cancer, whereas diagnoses were primarily used for studying ovarian cancer. The proficiency of the study design for endometrial cancer and uterine sarcoma was unclear because of the small number of studies conducted. The small size of the dataset and the lack of a dataset for external validation were indicated as the challenges of the studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","34629152","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Although gender neutral HPV vaccination programmes are expected to cause a reduction in the incidence rates of OPSCCs, these effects will not be evident in the foreseeable future. Secondary prevention strategies are currently not feasible due to an incomplete understanding of the natural history of oral HPV infections in OPSCCs. The key parameters that govern natural history models remain largely ill-defined for HPV related OPSCCs and cannot be easily inferred from experimental data. Mathematical models have been used to estimate some of these ill-defined parameters in cervical cancer, another HPV related cancer leading to successful implementation of cancer prevention strategies. We outline a ""double-Bayesian""mathematical modelling approach, whereby, a Bayesian machine learning model first estimates the probability of an individual having an oral HPV infection, given OPSCC and other covariate information. The model is then inverted using Bayes' theorem to reverse the probability relationship. We use data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, SEER Head and Neck with HPV Database and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), representing the adult population in the United States to derive our model. The model contains 8,106 OPSCC patients of which 73.0% had an oral HPV infection. When stratified by age, sex, marital status and race/ethnicity, the model estimated a higher conditional probability for developing OPSCCs given an oral HPV infection in non-Hispanic White males and females compared to other races/ethnicities. The proposed Bayesian model represents a proof-of-concept of a natural history model of HPV driven OPSCCs and outlines a strategy for estimating the conditional probability of an individual's risk of developing OPSCC following an oral HPV infection. © 2021 Tewari et al.

One of the efforts to decrease this mortality has focused on implementing automatic tools for supporting the experts in diagnosing this illness. In this work, eMODiTS was implemented to explore its performance in this particular domain. A comparison among the most used symbolic discretization (EP, SAX, αSAX, ESAX, ESAXKMeans, 1D-SAX, rSAX, and TD4C) methods and the well-known machine learning algorithms (kNN with k = 1,5,7, SVM, J48, and MLP) was done to analyze the eMODiTS performance. Results suggest that eMODiST outperforms most of the symbolic discretization methods concerning the statistical test results; only the results of the 1D-SAX algorithm do not present a significant statistical difference compared with eMODiTS. Although our proposal results are comparable with 1D-SAX, eMODiTS achieves these results with a more compressed data version. Concerning the comparison of machine learning-based methods, MLP outperforms eMODiTS. However, the classification performance and the ability to detect truly healthy and non-diseased cases are not sacrificed by eMODiTS. Moreover, the colposcopist validated the classification results confirming that the algorithm matched the real valorization. Finally, eMODiTS provides a visual tool for making decisions by experts about cervical cancer detection in the early stages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Cytokine gene variants and socio-demographic characteristics have been reported as biomarkers for determining the cervical cancer risk in the Indian population. This study was designed to apply a machine learning-based model using these risk factors for better prognosis and prediction of cervical cancer. This study includes the dataset of cytokine gene variants, clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of normal healthy control subjects, and cervical cancer cases. Different risk factors, including demographic details and cytokine gene variants, were analysed using different machine learning approaches. Various statistical parameters were used for evaluating the proposed method. After multi-step data processing and random splitting of the dataset, machine learning methods were applied and evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation and also tested on the unseen data records of a collected dataset for proper evaluation and analysis. The proposed approaches were verified after analysing various performance metrics. The logistic regression technique achieved the highest average accuracy of 82.25% and the highest average F1-score of 82.58% among all the methods. Ridge classifiers and the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier achieved the highest sensitivity—85%. The ridge classifier surpasses most of the machine learning classifiers with 84.78% accuracy and 97.83% sensitivity. The risk factors analysed in this study can be taken as biomarkers in developing a cervical cancer diagnosis system. The outcomes demonstrate that the machine learning assisted analysis of cytokine gene variants and socio-demographic characteristics can be utilised effectively for predicting the risk of developing cervical cancer. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","34147008","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Since the individual type of omics data only represents a single view that suffers from data noise and bias, multiple types of omics data are required for accurate cancer prognosis prediction. However, it is challenging to effectively integrate multi-omics data due to the large number of redundant variables but relatively small sample size. With the recent progress in deep learning techniques, Autoencoder was used to integrate multi-omics data for extracting representative features. Nevertheless, the generated model is fragile from data noises. Additionally, previous studies usually focused on individual cancer types without making comprehensive tests on pan-cancer. Here, we employed the denoising Autoencoder to get a robust representation of the multi-omics data, and then used the learned representative features to estimate patients’ risks. Results: By applying to 15 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), our method was shown to improve the C-index values over previous methods by 6.5% on average. Considering the difficulty to obtain multi-omics data in practice, we further used only mRNA data to fit the estimated risks by training XGboost models, and found the models could achieve an average C-index value of 0.627. As a case study, the breast cancer prognosis prediction model was independently tested on three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and shown able to significantly separate high-risk patients from low-risk ones (C-index>0.6, p-values<0.05). Based on the risk subgroups divided by our method, we identified nine prognostic markers highly associated with breast cancer, among which seven genes have been proved by literature review. Conclusion: Our comprehensive tests indicated that we have constructed an accurate and robust framework to integrate multi-omics data for cancer prognosis prediction. Moreover, it is an effective way to discover cancer prognosis-related genes. © 2021","33989895","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Early detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) can significantly increase the survival rate of patients. World Health Organization (WHO) divided the CIN into three grades (CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3). In clinical practice, different CIN grades require different treatments. Although existing studies proposed computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for cervical cancer diagnosis, most of them are fail to perform accurate separation between CIN1 and CIN2/3, due to the similar appearances under colposcopy. To boost the accuracy of CAD systems, we construct a colposcopic image dataset for GRAding cervical intraepithelial Neoplasia with fine-grained lesion Description (GRAND). The dataset consists of colposcopic images collected from 8,604 patients along with the pathological reports. Additionally, we invite the experienced colposcopist to annotate two main clues, which are usually adopted for clinical diagnosis of CIN grade, i.e., texture of acetowhite epithelium (TAE) and appearance of blood vessel (ABV). A multi-rater model using the annotated clues is benchmarked for our dataset. The proposed framework contains several sub-networks (raters) to exploit the fine-grained lesion features TAE and ABV, respectively, by contrastive learning and a backbone network to extract the global information from colposcopic images. A comprehensive experiment is conducted on our GRAND dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using additional lesion descriptions (TAE and ABV), which increases the CIN grading accuracy by over 10%. Furthermore, we conduct a human-machine confrontation to evaluate the potential of the proposed benchmark framework for clinical applications. Particularly, three colposcopists on different professional levels (intern, in-service and professional) are invited to compete with our benchmark framework by investigating a same extra test set—our framework achieves a comparable CIN grading accuracy to that of a professional colposcopist. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","33690025","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In regular cervical screening methods, such as colposcopy, an image is taken from the cervix of a patient. The particular image can be used by computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that are trained using artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the possibility of cervical cancer. Artificial intelligence models had been highlighted in a number of cervical cancer studies. However, there are a limited number of studies that investigate the simultaneous use of three colposcopic screening modalities including Greenlight, Hinselmann, and Schiller. Methods: We propose a cervical cancer predictor model which incorporates the result of different classification algorithms and ensemble classifiers. Our approach merges features of different colposcopic images of a patient. The feature vector of each image includes semantic medical features, subjective judgments, and a consensus. The class label of each sample is calculated using an aggregation function on expert judgments and consensuses. Results: We investigated different aggregation strategies to find the best formula for aggregation function and then we evaluated our method using the quality assessment of digital colposcopies dataset, and our approach performance with 96% of sensitivity and 94% of specificity values yields a significant improvement in the field. Conclusion: Our model can be used as a supportive clinical decision-making strategy by giving more reliable information to the clinical decision makers.

Early detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) can significantly increase the survival rate of patients. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for the accurate identification of LSIL+ (including CIN and cervical cancer) using time-lapsed colposcopic images. The proposed framework involves two main components, i.e., key-frame feature encoding networks and feature fusion network. The features of the original (pre-acetic-acid) image and the colposcopic images captured at around 60s, 90s, 120s and 150s during the acetic acid test are encoded by the feature encoding networks. Several fusion approaches are compared, all of which outperform the existing automated cervical cancer diagnosis systems using a single time slot. A graph convolutional network with edge features (E-GCN) is found to be the most suitable fusion approach in our study, due to its excellent explainability consistent with the clinical practice. A large-scale dataset, containing time-lapsed colposcopic images from 7,668 patients, is collected from the collaborative hospital to train and validate our deep learning framework. Colposcopists are invited to compete with our computer-aided diagnosis system. The proposed deep learning framework achieves a classification accuracy of 78.33%—comparable to that of an in-service colposcopist—which demonstrates its potential to provide assistance in the realistic clinical scenario. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Compared with traditional algorithms, several deep learning methods can improve the segmentation; however, due to blurred boundaries and complex gradients of medical images, the segmentation remains unsatisfactory. In addition, the existing datasets used by cervical cell nucleus segmentation research are lacking in terms of both quantity and diversity, so methods based on those datasets cannot effectively cope with challenging cases. This paper releases a new cervical cell dataset and proposes a network named Binary Tree-like Network with Two-path Fusion Attention Feature (BTTFA). The simplified diagram of BTTFA is similar to a binary tree structure and combines ResNeXt's last four layers of information by integrating adjacent pairs of layers each time; therefore, the information of multilayers can be fully integrated, and the information lost by the pooling layers can be recovered. BTTFA also applies a two-path fusion attention to selectively utilize information close to the root nodes, thereby taking full advantage of low-level detail and high-level semantic information and selectively emphasizing important features while suppressing less useful ones. Meanwhile, at some nodes of the binary tree-like network, focal loss is imposed to calculate the loss between the ground truth and the feature map during the training process. Experiments demonstrate that BTTFA performs better than the existing technology on our dataset and another public dataset. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","31005797","Article","Final","","Scopus"
